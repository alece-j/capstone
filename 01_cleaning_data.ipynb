    "The Pali Canon is the foundational collection of texts of the Theravada Buddhist Religion. It contains the oldest known records of the Buddha's teachings, compiled in written form about 500 years after the Buddha's death and maintained orally in the interim. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Canon is a diverse collection of works that documents teachings, stories, exclamations, quotes and poetry grouped into 5 separate collections by later compilers. Although it is little known and little studied in the west, the Canon and commentaries on it, form the core of the religion for hundreds of millions of Theravada Buddhists, particularly in South East Asia. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although translations from Pali (an ancient Sanskritic language) have existed for over one hundred years, the translations were often made by scholars who were not steeped in the living Buddhist monastic culture and discipline and often by those who did not practice. As such, it is unclear how often early translators had experiential insight into the meaning of often complex phenomena and concepts that are represented in the Canon. These insights are undoubtedly important for accurately representing a dead language (that contains many words/concepts with no direct equivalent in english) and, in turn, for outlining a path of practice to an unconditioned happiness that is as alive today as it was in the time of the Buddha. \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, however, as a result of an enormous effort by several English-speaking Buddhist monks, a large portion of the Pali Canon has been translated and made available online. The suttas that are the data for this project come from www.dhammatalks.org which hosts suttas translated by Ajahn Geoff, a monk of nearly 45 years in the Kammathana (Thai Forest Tradition) lineage. He has significant experience in translating both from Pali and Thai and is an inspiring monk in conduct and learnedness. "

    "The purpose of this project is two-fold:\n",
    "1. To do significant, public-facing, Natural Language Processing analysis on the Pali Canon. An investigation like this, at this scale, has, to my knowledge, never been conducted before. Given the recency of the availability of strong English translations of the Canon coupled with  fairly recent advances in Machine Learning algorithms that will be employed, the absence of an existing analyis at this level is less surprising than it might initially appear. Furthermore, the cross-section of lay-Theravadan Buddhists (non-monks) who are dedicated to reading the original texts (not 'Dhamma' books by other lay-Buddhist 'Dhamma teachers'), and people with an understanding of the tools needed to do this analyis probably yields quite a small number of people. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To develop a recommendation algorithm for suttas that could be used to support the development of particular mental qualities, themes and understandings within the religion. One could consider this to be a sort of 'Netflix' for information on how to develop along a path to an unconditioned happiness. For a rough understanding of the functionality, one can imagine a scenario where a user would input a particular theme, eg 'Generosity', and be recommended a number of suttas that deal with the subject and a number of closely related topics that might also be worth exploring."

This suggests that the verses originally may have been separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because they share the same refrain.\\n            \\n              The monk who subdues his arisen anger\\n              as, with herbs, snake-venom once it has spread,\\n              sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n              as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n                The monk who has cut off passion\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                as he would, plunging into a lake, a lotus,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who has cut off craving\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                drying up the swift-flowing flood,1\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who has uprooted conceit\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                as a great flood, a very weak bridge made of reeds,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk seeing\\n                in states of becoming\\n                no essence,\\n                as he would,\\n                when examining fig trees,\\n                no flowers,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk with no inner anger,\\n                who has thus gone beyond\\n                becoming &amp; not-,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk whose discursive thoughts are dispersed,\\n                well-dealt with inside\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,2\\n                transcending all\\n                this objectification,3\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,\\n                knowing with regard to the world\\n                that “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,\\n                without greed, as “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,\\n                without aversion, as “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or turned back,\\n                without delusion, as “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk in whom\\n                there are no obsessions4\\n                —the roots of unskillfulness totally destroyed—\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk in whom\\n                there’s nothing born of disturbance5\\n                that would lead him back to this shore,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk in whom\\n                there’s nothing born of the underbrush6\\n                that would act as a cause\\n                for binding him to becoming,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who’s abandoned five hindrances,\\n                who, untroubled, de-arrowed,7\\n                has crossed over doubt,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n            \\n            vv. 1–17\\n            \\n              Notes\\n              1.

This suggests that the verses originally may have been separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because they share the same refrain.\\n            \\n              The monk who subdues his arisen anger\\n              as, with herbs, snake-venom once it has spread,\\n              sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n              as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n                The monk who has cut off passion\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                as he would, plunging into a lake, a lotus,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who has cut off craving\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                drying up the swift-flowing flood,1\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who has uprooted conceit\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                as a great flood, a very weak bridge made of reeds,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk seeing\\n                in states of becoming\\n                no essence,\\n                as he would,\\n                when examining fig trees,\\n                no flowers,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk with no inner anger,\\n                who has thus gone beyond\\n                becoming &amp; not-,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk whose discursive thoughts are dispersed,\\n                well-dealt with inside\\n                without leaving a trace,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,2\\n                transcending all\\n                this objectification,3\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,\\n                knowing with regard to the world\\n                that “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,\\n                without greed, as “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,\\n                without aversion, as “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or turned back,\\n                without delusion, as “All this is unreal,”\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk in whom\\n                there are no obsessions4\\n                —the roots of unskillfulness totally destroyed—\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk in whom\\n                there’s nothing born of disturbance5\\n                that would lead him back to this shore,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk in whom\\n                there’s nothing born of the underbrush6\\n                that would act as a cause\\n                for binding him to becoming,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n              \\n                The monk who’s abandoned five hindrances,\\n                who, untroubled, de-arrowed,7\\n                has crossed over doubt,\\n                sloughs off the near shore &amp; far—\\n                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.\\n              \\n            \\n            vv. 1–17\\n            \\n              Notes\\n              1.
