              The monk who subdues his arisen anger
              as, with herbs, snake-venom once it has spread,
              sloughs off the near shore & far—
              as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
              
                The monk who has cut off passion
                without leaving a trace,
                as he would, plunging into a lake, a lotus,
                sloughs off the near shore & far—
                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
              
              
                The monk who has cut off craving
                without leaving a trace,
                drying up the swift-flowing flood,1
                sloughs off the near shore & far—
                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
              
              
                The monk who has uprooted conceit
                without leaving a trace,
                as a great flood, a very weak bridge made of reeds,
                sloughs off the near shore & far—
                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
              
              
                The monk seeing
                in states of becoming
                no essence,
                as he would,
                when examining fig trees,
                no flowers,

                The monk whose discursive thoughts are dispersed,
                well-dealt with inside
                without leaving a trace,

                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,2

                this objectification,3

                The monk who hasn’t slipped past or held back,
                knowing with regard to the world
                that “All this is unreal,”

                The monk in whom
                there are no obsessions4

                The monk in whom
                there’s nothing born of disturbance5
                that would lead him back to this shore,
                sloughs off the near shore & far—

                The monk in whom
                there’s nothing born of the underbrush6

                for binding him to becoming,

                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
              
              
                The monk who’s abandoned five hindrances,
                who, untroubled, de-arrowed,7
                has crossed over doubt,

            vv. 1–17","            Alternative versions of this poem—a Sanskrit version included in the Udānavarga, and a Gāndhārī version included in the Gāndhārī Dharmapada—have many of the same verses included here, but arranged in a different order. This suggests that the verses originally may have been separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because they share the same refrain.

              1. Dhaniya Gopa: literally, One Whose Wealth is in Cattle. According to SnA, his herd consisted of 30,000 head of cattle.
              2. The first line in the Buddha’s verse plays on words in the first line of Dhaniya’s. “Free from anger” (akkodhano) plays on “rice is cooked” (pakkodano); and “rigidity” (khilo) plays on “milk” (khīro).
              3. “Open” means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is also used at Ud 5:5 and Sn 4:4. “My fire out” refers to the fires of passion, aversion, & delusion; birth, aging, & death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair. See SN 35:28; Iti 93; and The Mind Like Fire Unbound.
              4. The raft stands for the noble eightfold path. See MN 22 and SN 35:197.
              5. As this verse doesn’t seem to be a direct response to the preceding one, SnA suggests that we are missing part of the conversation here. An alternative possibility is that the Buddha is engaging in word play—the word “crossed over” (tiṇṇa) being a pun on Dhaniya’s reference to grass (tiṇa).
              6. According to SnA, the Buddha is not in anyone else’s employ nor even in his own employ—i.e., he is not in the employ of craving.
              7. The Buddha may be speaking literally here—he has no cattle, so there is no way that a heavy rain could cause him harm—but he may also be speaking metaphorically. See SN 4:19 and Thag 1:1.
              8. See MN 66.
              9. This verse is quoted in the Milinda Pañhā.
              10. On the theme of the Buddha as “One with Eyes,” see DN 16, note 44.",", Sn 2:12, note 2.
              11. According to SnA, Māra suddenly comes on the scene to try—unsuccessfully—to prevent Dhaniya and his wife from going forth. His verses here, together with the Buddha’s response, are also found at SN 4:8.
              12. See Sn 3:12, note 2.

              like a rhinoceros.
              
                For a person by nature entangled
                there are affections;
                on the heels of affection, this pain.
                Seeing the drawback born of affection,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                One whose mind
                is enmeshed in sympathy
                for friends & companions,
                neglects the goal.
                Seeing this danger in intimacy,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Like spreading bamboo,
                entwined,
                is concern for offspring & spouses.
                Like a bamboo sprout,
                unentangling,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                As a deer in the wilds,
                unfettered,2
                goes for forage wherever it wants:
                The observant person, valuing freedom,
                wanders alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                In the midst of companions
                —when staying at home,
                when going out wandering—
                you are prey to requests.
                Valuing the freedom
                that no one else covets,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                There is sporting & love
                in the midst of companions,
                & abundant love for offspring.
                Feeling disgust
                at the prospect of parting
                from those who’d be dear,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Without resistance in all four directions,
                content with whatever you get,
                enduring troubles without panic,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                They are hard to please,
                some of those gone forth,
                as well as those living the household life.
                Being unconcerned
                with the offspring of others,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Cutting off the householder’s marks,3
                like a kovilara tree
                that has shed its leaves,
                the enlightened one, cutting all household ties,
                wanders alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                
                  If you gain an astute companion,
                  a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened,
                  overcoming all troubles,
                  go with him, gratified,
                  mindful.
                
              
              
                
                  If you don’t gain an astute companion,
                  a fellow traveler, right-living & wise,
                  wander alone
                  like a king renouncing his kingdom,
                  like the elephant in the Mataṅga wilds,
                  [his herd].4
                
              
              
                We praise companionship
                —yes!
                Those on a par, or better,
                should be chosen as friends.
                If they’re not to be found,
                living faultlessly,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Seeing radiant bracelets of gold,
                well-made by a smith,
                clinking, clashing,
                two on an arm,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros,
              
              
                [Thinking:]
                “In the same way,
                if I were to live with another,
                there would be conversation or attachment.”
                Seeing this future danger,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Because sensual pleasures,
                elegant, honeyed, & charming,
                bewitch the mind with their manifold forms—
                seeing this drawback in sensual strings5—
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                “Calamity, tumor, misfortune,
                disease, an arrow, a danger for me.”
                Seeing this danger in sensual strings,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Cold & heat, hunger & thirst,
                wind & sun, horseflies & snakes:
                Enduring all these, without exception,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                As a great white elephant,
                with massive shoulders,
                renouncing his herd,
                lives in the wilds wherever he wants,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                “There’s no way
                that one delighting in company
                can touch even momentary release.”6
                Heeding the words
                of the Kinsman of the Sun,7
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Transcending the contortion of views,8
                the sure way attained,
                the path gained,
                [realizing:]
                “Unled by others,
                I have knowledge arisen,”
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                With no greed, no deceit,
                no thirst, no hypocrisy—
                delusion & blemishes
                blown away—
                with no inclinations for all the world,
                every world,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Avoid the evil companion
                disregarding the goal,
                intent on the discordant9 way.
                Don’t associate yourself
                with someone heedless & hankering.
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Consort with one who is learned,
                who maintains the Dhamma,
                a great & quick-witted friend.
                Knowing the meanings,
                subdue your perplexity,
                [then] wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Free from longing, finding no pleasure
                in the world’s sport, ardor, or sensual bliss,
                abstaining from adornment,
                speaking the truth,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Abandoning offspring, spouse,
                father, mother,
                riches, grain, relatives,
                & sensual pleasures
                altogether,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                “This is a bondage.
                There’s little happiness here,
                next to no enjoyment,
                all the more suffering & pain.10
                This is a boil”11:
                Knowing this, circumspect,

                Shattering fetters,
                like a fish in the water tearing a net,
                like a fire not coming back to what’s burnt,
                wander alone

                Eyes downcast, not footloose,
                senses guarded, with protected mind,
                not soggy, not burning,12

                Taking off the householder’s marks,13
                like a coral tree
                that has shed its leaves,
                going forth in the ochre robe,

                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Showing no greed for flavors, not wanton,
                going from house to house for alms
                with mind unenmeshed in this family or that,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Abandoning barriers to awareness,
                expelling all defilements—all—
                non-dependent, cutting aversion,
                affection,

                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Turning your back on pleasure & pain,
                as earlier with sorrow & joy,
                attaining pure
                equanimity,
                tranquility,14
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                With persistence aroused
                for the highest goal’s attainment,
                with mind unsmeared, not lazy in action,
                firm in effort, with steadfastness & strength arisen,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Not neglecting seclusion, jhāna,
                constantly living the Dhamma
                in line with the Dhamma,
                comprehending the danger
                in states of becoming,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Intent on the ending of craving & heedful,
                neither drooling nor dumb,
                but learned, mindful,
                —having reckoned the Dhamma—
                certain & striving,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Unstartled,     like a lion at sounds.
                Unsnared,     like the wind in a net.
                Unsmeared,     like a lotus in water15:
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Like a lion—forceful, strong in fang,
                living as a conqueror, the king of beasts—
                resort to a solitary dwelling.
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                At the right time consorting
                with the release through goodwill,
                compassion,
                empathetic joy,
                equanimity,
                unobstructed by all the world,
                any world,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Having let go of     passion,
                aversion,
                delusion;
                having shattered     the fetters;
                unfazed     at the ending of life,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                People follow & associate
                for a motive.
                Friends without a motive these days
                are rare.
                They’re shrewd for their own ends, & impure.
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
            
            vv. 35–75","The refrain in this sutta is a subject of controversy. The text literally says, “Wander alone like a ‘sword-horn,’ which is the Pali term for rhinoceros. SnA, however, insists that this refers not to the animal but to its horn, because the Indian rhinoceros, unlike the African, has only one horn. Still, some scholars have noted that while the Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal, rhinoceros horns don’t wander, and that in other verses in the Pali Canon, the phrase “wander alone like…” takes a person or an animal, not an animal part, for its object. Thus, for example, in Dhp 329 (repeated below), one is told to “wander alone like a king renouncing his kingdom, like the elephant in the Mataṅga woods, his herd.” It’s possible that the rhinoceros was chosen here as an example of solitary wandering both because of its habits and because of its unusual single horn. However, in a translation, it’s necessary to choose one reading over the other. Thus, because wandering ”like a rhinoceros” sounds more natural than wandering “like a horn,” I have chosen the former rendering. Keep in mind, though, that the singularity of the rhinoceros horn reinforces the image.
            Other versions of this poem exist in Sanskrit: a short Sanskrit version in the Mahāvastu, and a Gāndhārī version in a manuscript discovered in Central Asia. The Gāndhārī version contains many of the same verses given here, but in a different order. The Mahāvastu version contains only 12 verses, but it is followed by a statement that the full version of the sutta contained 500 verses. How that number was achieved is suggested by the fact that, of the 12 verses, several contain only minor variations from one another. All of this suggests that the verses here originally may have been separate poems, composed on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because of their common refrain.
            Like the Pārānaya Vagga, this poem is given a detailed interpretation in Nd II. Nd II ends its discussion of this sutta by saying that it was spoken by a Private Buddha, i.e., one who gains awakening on his own but is unable to formulate the Dhamma in such a way as to teach others to gain awakening. This assertion, however, is contradicted by the content of some of the verses, such as the one beginning, “Consort with one who is learned, who maintains the Dhamma, a great & quick-witted friend.” Such a friend would not have existed in the time of a Private Buddha.
            There is evidence suggesting that in the centuries after the rule of King Asoka, monastery-dwelling monks began to look askance at forest-dwelling monks, and in some cases even forbade them from entering the precincts around the stupas of their monasteries. Because Nd I and Nd II were most likely composed by monastery-dwelling monks, it might be the case that they tried to blunt the message of this sutta by attributing it to a Private Buddha rather than to our Buddha, the implication being that its advice was not appropriate for monks of their day and age.

              1. Nd II details the various ways in which a Private Buddha can be said to wander alone (eko). Two of the ways have to do with physical seclusion: He goes forth alone and wanders without a companion. The remaining have to do with mental seclusion: He has abandoned craving; is free of passion, aversion, and delusion; and has followed the path going one way only (ekāyanamagga). Interestingly enough, Nd II defines this path, not as just the four establishings of mindfulness (see DN 22) but as all seven sets of dhammas in the Wings to Awakening.
              Nd II illustrates its reference to the abandoning of craving as a type of seclusion with this verse from Iti 15:
              
                With craving his companion, a man
                wanders on a long, long time.
                Neither in this state here
                nor anywhere else
                does he go beyond
                the wandering-on.
                Knowing this drawback—
                that craving brings stress into play—
                free          from craving,
                devoid     of clinging,
                mindful,     the monk
                lives the mendicant life. 
              
              Nd II illustrates its reference to the path going one way only with this verse from SN 47:18 and SN 47:43:
              
                One with vision of the ending of birth,
                sympathetic to welfare,
                discerns the path going one way only,
                by which, in the past, they crossed over,
                are now crossing over,
                and will cross over
                the flood.
              
              2. SN 35:191 lists two fetters: desire and passion. AN 10:13 lists ten: self-identification views, uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices, sensual desire, ill will, passion for form, passion for what is formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. 
              3. Hair and beard.
              4. These verses = Dhp 328–329.
              5. “There are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire; sounds cognizable via the ear… aromas cognizable via the nose… flavors cognizable via the tongue… tactile sensations cognizable via the body—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire. But these are not sensuality. They are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones.” — AN 6:63
              6. The temporary release from such things as the hindrances, attained when entering right concentration, or the temporary release from some of the factors of lower states of jhāna, attained when entering higher states of jhāna. This release lasts only as long as the necessary causal factors are still in place. This is apparently the same thing as the occasional release/liberation mentioned in MN 29. See note 2 to that sutta.
              7. An epithet for the Buddha.
              8. According to Nd II, the views here are the 20 forms of identity-views (see SN 22:1) and the 62 views discussed in DN 1. (The connection between these two lists is discussed in SN 41:3.) MN 2, however, explains a “contortion of views” in different terms, which may have been intended here.
              9. Visama. See Sn 1:12, note 11.
              10. See MN 54.
              11. Reading gaṇḍo with the Thai editions. The other editions have gaḷo, fishhook. See AN 9:15.
              12. Nd II explains “not soggy” by quoting Ven. Mahā Moggallāna’s words in SN 35:202. The central part of the passage is this: “And how is one soggy? There is the case where a monk, when seeing a form via the eye, is, in the case of pleasing forms, committed to forms and, in the case of displeasing forms, afflicted by forms. He remains with body-mindfulness not present, and with limited awareness. And he does not discern, as it has come to be, the awareness-release & discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace. [Similarly with the remaining sense media.] … 
              “And how is one not soggy? There is the case where a monk, when seeing a form via the eye, is not, in the case of pleasing forms, committed to forms nor, in the case of displeasing forms, afflicted by forms. He remains with body-mindfulness present, and with immeasurable awareness. And he discerns, as it has come to be, the awareness-release & discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace. [Similarly with the remaining sense media.]”","AN 3:110.
              According to Nd II, “not burning” means not burning with the fires of passion, aversion, and delusion. See SN 35:28 and Iti 93.
              13. Lay clothing.
              14. This is a reference to the fourth jhāna. See MN 119.
              15. These lines are repeated at Sn 1:12.

Sn 1:4  To Kasi Bhāradvāja,Sn 1:4,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp1_4.html,Sn 1:4  To Kasi Bhāradvāja  —  The Buddha answers a farmer who claims that monks do no useful work and so don’t deserve to eat.,"KN/Sn/1:4
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans in Dakkhiṇāgiri near the brahman village of Ekanāḷā. Now at that time approximately 500 of the brahman Kasi [Plowing] Bhāradvāja’s plows were yoked at the sowing time. Then, in the early morning, after adjusting his lower robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, the Blessed One went to where Kasi Bhāradvāja was working. Now at that time Kasi Bhāradvāja’s food-distribution was underway. So the Blessed One went to Kasi Bhāradvāja’s food-distribution and, on arrival, stood to one side. Kasi Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One standing for alms, and on seeing him, said to him, “I, contemplative, plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, I eat. You, too, contemplative, should plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, you (will) eat.”
            “I, too, brahman, plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, I eat.”
            “But, contemplative, we don’t see the Master Gotama’s yoke or plow, plowshare, goad, or oxen, and yet the Master Gotama says this: ‘I, too, brahman, plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, I eat.’”
            Then Kasi Bhāradvāja addressed the Blessed One with a verse:
            
              You claim to be a plowman,
              but we don’t see your plowing.
              Being asked, tell us about your plowing
              so that we may know your plowing.
              
                The Buddha:
                Conviction’s     my seed,
                austerity     my rain,
                discernment     my yoke & plow,
                shame     my pole,
                mind     my yoke-tie,
                mindfulness     my plowshare & goad.
              
              
                Guarded in body,
                guarded in speech,
                restrained in terms of belly & food,
                I make truth a weeding-hook,
                and composure my unyoking.
                Persistence, my beast of burden,
                bearing me toward rest from the yoke,
                takes me, without turning back,
                to where, having gone,
                one doesn’t grieve.
                That’s how my plowing is plowed.
                It has
                as its fruit
                the deathless.
                Having plowed this plowing,
                one is unyoked
                from all suffering
                & stress.
              
            
            Then Kasi Bhāradvāja, having heaped up milk-rice in a large bronze serving bowl, offered it to the Blessed One, [saying,] “May Master Gotama eat [this] milk-rice. The master is a plowman, for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless.”
            
              The Buddha:
              What’s been chanted over with verses
              shouldn’t be eaten by me.
              That’s not the nature, brahman,
              of one who’s seen rightly.
              What’s been chanted over with verses
              Awakened Ones reject.
              That being their Dhamma, brahman,
              this is their way of life.
              Serve with other food & drink
              a fully-perfected great seer,
              his effluents     ended,
              his anxiety     stilled,
              for that is the field
              for one looking for merit.
            
            “Then to whom, Master Gotama, should I give this milk-rice?”
            “Brahman, I don’t see that person in this world—with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk—by whom this milk-rice, having been eaten, would be rightly digested, aside from a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata’s disciple. In that case, brahman, throw the milk-rice away in a place without vegetation, or dump it in water with no living beings.”
            So Kasi Bhāradvāja dumped the milk-rice in water with no living beings. And the milk-rice, when dropped in the water, hissed & sizzled, seethed & steamed. Just as an iron ball heated all day, when tossed in the water, hisses & sizzles, seethes & steams, in the same way the milk-rice, when dropped in the water, hissed & sizzled, seethed & steamed.
            Then Kasi Bhāradvāja—in awe, his hair standing on end—went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, said to him, “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life. Let me obtain the Going-forth in Master Gotama’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance (into the Bhikkhu Saṅgha).”
            Then the brahman Kasi Bhāradvāja obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Bhāradvāja became another one of the arahants.

              of craving,
              supreme
              among two-legged beings,

              Please tell me.
              
                The Buddha:
                Four contemplatives, there is no fifth.
                Being asked in person, I disclose them to you:
                the path-victor, the path-explainer,

                is refreshed in unbinding,
                devoid of greed,

                the foremost as foremost,
                who points out,
                who analyzes the Dhamma right here,
                he, the cutter of doubt, the sage unperturbed,
                is called the second of monks:
                path-explainer.
              
              
                Whoever lives by the path,
                the Dhamma-way well-explained,
                restrained, mindful,
                partaking of blameless ways,
                is called the third of monks:
                with the path as his life.
              
              
                Making a façade of good practices,
                brash, reckless, a corrupter of families,1

            I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One.

              About the man in decline

              having come to question the Blessed One:
              What is the way leading to decline?
              
                The Buddha:
                Easily known     is the one of good prospects;
                easily known,1     the one in decline.
                The one of good prospects
                loves the Dhamma,
                the one in decline
                detests it.
              
              
                The deva:
                We know, indeed, that that is so.
                That’s the first one in decline.
                May the Blessed One tell the second:

                The wicked are dear to him,
                the good he doesn’t hold dear.
                He approves of the ideas of the wicked:
                That is the way leading to decline.
              
              
                The deva:
                We know, indeed, that that is so.

                Prone to sleep, prone to company,
                the man with no initiative,
                lazy & known for his anger:
                That is the way leading to decline.
              
              
                The deva:
                We know, indeed, that that is so.
                That’s the third one in decline.

                Though capable, one doesn’t support
                one’s mother or father
                —old, their youth over & done:
                That is the way leading to decline.

                a brahman, contemplative,
                or other mendicant:
                That is the way leading to decline.

                with gold & food,
                enjoys his luxuries alone:

                proud of his wealth,
                proud of his clan,
                despises his own relatives:

                with timbara-fruit breasts,
                and, jealous of her, doesn’t sleep:
                That is the way leading to decline.

                a woman given to drink & squandering
                or a man of that sort:

Sn 1:7  An Outcaste,Sn 1:7,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp1_7.html,"Sn 1:7  An Outcaste  —  Being an outcaste is a matter of behavior, not birth.","KN/Sn/1:7
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, in the early morning, after adjusting his lower robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, he entered Sāvatthī for alms. Now at that time, in the house of the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja, a (sacrificial) fire was burning and an offering was lifted up. Then the Blessed One, going through Sāvatthī on a methodical almsround,1 approached the house of Aggika Bhāradvāja. Aggika Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, on seeing him, said to him: “Stop right there, you little shaveling! Right there, you little contemplative! Right there, you little outcaste!”
            When this was said, the Blessed One said to the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja, “But do you know, brahman, what an outcaste is, or the actions that make one an outcaste?”
            “No, in fact, Master Gotama, I don’t know what an outcaste is, or the actions that make one an outcaste. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I would know what an outcaste is and the actions that make one an outcaste.”
            “In that case, brahman, listen and pay close attention. I will speak.”
            “As you say, master,” the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja responded to the Blessed One.
            The Blessed One said:
            
              Whatever man is angry, resentful,
              evil, merciless,
              deceitful, and defective in his views:
              He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
                Whoever here harms a living being
                once-born or twice-born,2
                who has no sympathy for a living being:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever destroys or besieges

                Whoever, from village or wilderness,
                takes in a manner of theft

                Whoever, actually incurring a debt,
                when pressed to pay, evades,
                (saying,) ‘I’m in no debt to you’:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, desiring whatever-the-thing,
                strikes a person going along a road,
                to take whatever-the-thing:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whatever man, for his own sake,

                or the sake of wealth,

                teaches what’s not

                Whoever, doing an evil deed,
                wishes, ‘May I not be known,’

                Whoever, having gone to another’s house,
                being offered pure food,
                doesn’t honor (the host) in return
                when he comes (to one’s house):
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever deceives with a lie

                Whoever, when a brahman or contemplative
                appears at mealtime,
                reviles him with speech and doesn’t give:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’3
              
              
                Whoever, wrapped in delusion,

                Whoever exalts himself
                and disparages others,4
                debased by his own pride:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Angry, mean, evil in his desires,
                miserly, dishonest,
                devoid of shame & compunction:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever heaps verbal abuse
                on an Awakened One
                or his disciple,
                wanderer or householder:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, though not an arahant,
                claims to be an arahant:
                He is the thief in this world with its Brahmās.5
                He is the vilest of outcastes.
              
              
                These are said to be outcastes,
                as I have proclaimed them to you.
                Not by birth is one an outcaste,
                not by birth a brahman.
                By action one is an outcaste.
                By action is one a brahman.6
              
              
                Know, too, by this,
                as I give an example:
                Sopāka, the son of an outcaste,
                was well-known as Mātaṅga:
                He, Mātaṅga,
                attained the highest prestige,
                hard to gain.
                They came into his service,
                many noble warriors & brahmans.
                Mounting the divine chariot,7
                and the great, stainless road,
                dispassioned for sensual passion,
                he reached the world of the Brahmās.
                His birth didn’t prevent him
                from reaching the world of the Brahmās.
              
              
                Though born into a family of scholars,
                brahmans, with chants as their kinsmen,
                are repeatedly seen with evil deeds:
                blameworthy in the here-&-now,
                with a bad destination in the afterlife.
                Their birth doesn’t prevent them
                from blame & a bad destination.
              
              
                Not by birth is one an outcaste,
                not by birth a brahman.
                By action one is an outcaste.
                By action is one a brahman.
              
            
            When this was said, the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”

              This is to be done by one skilled in aims
              appreciating the state of peace:
              Be capable, upright, & straightforward,
              easy to instruct, gentle, & not conceited,
              content & easy to support,
              with few duties, living lightly,
              with peaceful faculties, astute,
              modest, & no greed for supporters.
              
                Do not do the slightest thing
                that the observant would later censure.
              
              
                Think: Happy, at rest,
                may all beings be happy at heart.
                Whatever beings there may be,
                weak or strong, without exception,
                long, large,
                middling, short,
                subtle, gross,
                seen & unseen,
                living near & far away,
                born or seeking birth:
                May all beings be happy at heart.
                Let no one deceive another
                or despise anyone anywhere,
                or, through anger or resistance-perception,
                wish for another to suffer.
              
              
                As a mother would risk her life
                to protect her child, her only child,
                even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly
                with regard to all beings.1
                With goodwill for the entire cosmos,
                cultivate the heart limitlessly:
                above, below, & all around,
                unobstructed, without hostility or hate.
                Whether standing, walking,
                sitting, or lying down,
                as long as one has banished torpor,
                one should be resolved on this mindfulness.2
                This is called a Brahmā abiding
                here.
              
              
                Not taken with views,
                but virtuous & consummate in vision,
                having subdued greed for sensuality,
                one never again
                will lie in the womb.

              1. The image here is sometimes misconstrued as saying that one should protect all beings as a mother would protect her only child. Actually, the parallel is not between the child and all living beings; it is between the child and one’s cultivation of the heart: One should protect one’s goodwill toward all beings in the same way that a mother would protect her only child.

              Today is the fifteenth,
              the uposatha day.
              A divine night is at hand.
              Let’s go see Gotama,
              the Teacher perfectly named.
              
                Hemavata the yakkha:
                Is his mind well-directed,
                Such,1 toward all beings?
                Are his resolves mastered

                Hemavata the yakkha:
                Does he not take what’s not given?
                Is he restrained toward beings?

                and he’s restrained toward beings.
                He’s far from complacency and,
                awakened, he does not neglect jhāna.
              
              
                Hemavata the yakkha:
                Does he not tell lies?
                Do his ways of speaking not cut things off?
                Does he not speak destructively?

                His ways of speaking don’t cut things off.
                He doesn’t speak destructively.
                Deliberating, he speaks what’s of benefit.
              
              
                Hemavata the yakkha:
                Is he not passionate for sensuality?
                Is his mind unmuddied?
                Has he gone beyond delusion?

                enlightened,
                with legs like an antelope, thin,
                eating little, not greedy,
                doing jhāna in the forest.
                Having gone to the nāga,5
                the lion wandering alone,
                indifferent to sensuality,
                let’s ask him
                about release from Death’s snare.
                Let’s ask Gotama,
                proclaimer, preacher,
                attained to the far shore
                of all phenomena:
                awakened,
                gone past animosity
                & fear.

                From clinging to what

                In six does it make acquaintance.
                From clinging just to six

                The five strings of sensuality in the world,8
                with the heart described as the sixth:
                Being dispassioned for desire there:
                That’s how one’s released

                internally percipient,10 mindful,

                overcoming all fetters,
                having totally ended delight in becoming,

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Āḷavī in the haunt of the Āḷavaka yakkha. Then the Āḷavaka yakkha went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him: “Get out, contemplative!”
            [Saying,] “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went out.
            “Come in, contemplative!”
            “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went in.
            A second time.… A third time, the Āḷavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, “Get out, contemplative!”
            “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went out.
            “Come in, contemplative!”
            “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went in.
            Then a fourth time, the Āḷavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, “Get out, contemplative!”
            “I won’t go out, my friend. Do what you have to do.”
            “I will ask you a question, contemplative. If you can’t answer me, I will hurl out your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges.”
            “My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, who could hurl out my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges. But nevertheless, ask me what you wish.”

                truth,

                How could I go ask
                common brahmans & contemplatives?—
                now that today I discern
                what benefits
                the next life.
                It was truly for my well-being
                that the Awakened One came
                to stay in Āḷavī.
                Today I discern
                where what is given
                bears great fruit.

              Whether walking, standing,
              sitting, or lying down,
              it flexes & stretches:
              This is the body’s movement.
              Joined together with tendons & bones,
              plastered over with muscle & skin,
              hidden by complexion,
              the body isn’t seen
              for what it is:
              filled with intestines, filled with stomach,
              with the lump of the liver,
              bladder, lungs, heart,
              kidneys, spleen,
              mucus, sweat, saliva, fat,
              blood, synovial fluid, bile, & oil.
              On top of that,
              in nine streams,
              filth is always flowing from it—
              from the eyes : eye secretions,
              from the ears : ear secretions,
              from the nose : mucus,
              from the mouth it vomits :
              now vomit,
              now phlegm,
              now bile;
              from the body : beads of sweat.
              
                And on top of that,
                its hollow head is filled with brains.
                The fool, beset by ignorance,
                thinks it beautiful,
                but when it lies dead,
                swollen, livid,
                cast away in a charnel ground,
                even relatives don’t care for it.
                Dogs feed on it,
                jackals, wolves, & worms.
                Crows & vultures feed on it,
                along with any other animals there.
              
              
                Having heard the Awakened One’s words,
                the discerning monk
                comprehends, for he sees it
                for what it is:
                “As this is, so is that.
                As that, so this.”
                Within & without,
                he should let desire for the body
                fade away.
                With desire & passion faded away,
                the discerning monk arrives here:
                at the deathless,
                the calm,
                the unfallen, undying1 state

                This two-footed thing is cared for,
                filthy, evil-smelling,
                filled with various carcasses,
                oozing out here & there:
                Whoever would think,
                on the basis of a body like this,
                to exalt himself or disparage another—
                What is that

                These two are different,

                and the unselfish one, of good practices.
                Slaying other beings, the householder
                is unrestrained.
                Constantly the sage protects other beings,
                is controlled.
              
              
                Just as the crested,
                blue-necked peacock,
                when flying,

                the wild goose
                in speed,

                never keeps up with the monk—
                the sage secluded
                in the forest,
                doing jhāna.

              1. SnA: Dangers in intimacy = Craving and views.
              2. SnA: Dust = Passion, aversion, and delusion.
              3. This verse is quoted in the Milinda Pañhā. The poem as a whole is apparently the same as the Munigāthā mentioned in King Asoka’s Calcutta-Bairāṭ edict.
              4. SnA: Ground, seed, and sap = The aggregates, sense media, and properties form the ground in which grows the seed of constructive consciousness—the consciousness that develops into states of being and birth. (For other instances of this image, see SN 22:53­–55.) The sap of this seed is craving and views.
              5. SnA: Dwellings (nivesanāni) = States of becoming and birth. This term can also be translated as “entrenchments.” See Sn 4:3, note 2.
              6. SnA: He does not build = He performs none of the good or bad deeds that give rise to further states of becoming and birth. See Dhp 39, 267, and 412.
              7. Effluent (āsava): Three qualities—sensual desire, states of becoming, or ignorance—that “flow out” of the mind and defile it. Sometimes a fourth quality—views—is added to the list, to connect these qualities with the four floods (ogha), which are identical to the four yokes. See AN 4:10.
              8. See Sn 1:3.
              9. The pillar at a bathing ford: Cv V.l describes this as an immovable pillar, standing quite tall and buried deep in the ground near a bathing place, against which young villagers and boxers would rub their bodies while bathing so as to toughen them. The “extremes” in which others speak, according to SnA, are extremes of praise and criticism: These leave the sage, like the pillar, unmoved.
              10. SnA: Straight as a shuttle = Having a mind unprejudiced by desire, aversion, delusion, or fear. See AN 4:19.
              11. Consonant and discordant (sama and visama): Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments were metaphors for good. In Pali, the term sama—”even”—described an instrument tuned on-pitch. AN 6:55 contains a famous passage in which the Buddha reminds Ven. Soṇa Kolivisa—who had been over-exerting himself in the practice—that a lute sounds appealing only if the strings are neither too taut nor too lax, but “evenly” tuned. This image would have special resonances with the Buddha’s teaching on the middle way. It also adds meaning to the term samaṇa—monk or contemplative—which the texts frequently mention as being derived from sama. The word sāmañña—”evenness,” the quality of being concordant and in tune—also means the quality of being a contemplative. The true contemplative is always in tune with what is proper and good.","DN 2, MN 61, MN 97. Nd II, in commenting on Sn 4:2, equates discordant conduct with the ten types of misconduct described in MN 41.
              12. Intoxication: The three intoxications are intoxication with youth, with good health, and with life. See AN 3:39.
              13. SnA: Ocean = The way defilement splashes into undesirable destinations.
              14. Flood: The flow of defilement: sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance. See SN 45:171.
              15. Such (tādiṁ): Unchanging; unaffected by anything, while at the same time undefined.

              5. Four states of deprivation: rebirth as an animal, a hungry ghost, an angry demon, or a denizen of hell. In the Buddhist cosmology, none of these states is eternal.
              6. According to SnA, the six great wrongs are: murdering one’s mother, murdering one’s father, murdering an arahant (fully awakened individual), wounding a Buddha, causing a schism in the Saṅgha, or choosing anyone other than a Buddha as one’s foremost teacher. The first five are listed in AN 5:129 as leading immediately to hell after death.

            “I will ask you a question, contemplative. If you can’t answer me, I will hurl out your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges.”
            “My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, who could hurl out my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges. But nevertheless, ask me what you wish.”
            So Suciloma the yakkha addressed the Blessed One in verse:
            
              Passion & aversion
              come from what cause?
              Displeasure, delight,
              horripilation
              are born from what?
              Arising from what
              do thoughts fling the mind around,
              as boys, a (captive) crow?
              
                The Buddha:
                Passion & aversion
                come from this1 as a cause;
                displeasure, delight,
                horripilation
                are born from this;
                arising from this
                thoughts fling the mind around,
                as boys, a (captive) crow:
                They’re born from affection
                arisen from     the mind,
                from     oneself,2
                like the trunk-born (shoots)
                of a banyan tree,
                thick, attached to sensuality,
                like a māluva vine spread in a forest.
                Those who discern where it’s born
                drive it out—listen, yakkha!
                They cross over this flood,
                so hard to cross,
                never crossed before,
                for the sake of no further becoming.

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then many Kosalan brahmans of great means—old, aged, advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life—approached the Blessed One. On arrival, they exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to him, “Master Gotama, do brahmans at present live in conformity with the brahman principles of ancient brahmans?”
            “No, brahmans. Brahmans at present don’t live in conformity with the brahman principles of ancient brahmans.”
            “It would be good if Master Gotama described the brahman principles of ancient brahmans, if it wouldn’t burden him.”
            “In that case, brahmans, listen and pay close attention. I will speak.”
            “As you say, master,” the brahmans of great means responded to the Blessed One.
            The Blessed One said:
            
              Seers, before,     were austere
              & restrained in mind.
              Abandoning the five strings of sensuality,
              they practiced for their own benefit.
              They had          no cattle,
              no gold,
              no wealth.
              They had study
              as their wealth.
              They protected the Brahmā treasure.1
              They did not despise what was prepared for them:
              food set at doors, prepared out of conviction
              for those who seek.
              
                Prosperous lands & kingdoms
                honored brahmans with multi-colored clothes,
                bedding, & dwellings.
                Brahmans
                protecting their principles,
                protected by law,2
                were not to be violated,
                not to be beaten.
                No one could block them
                from the doors of any home.
              
              
                For 48 years (young brahmans)
                followed the holy life.
                Brahmans of old practiced the search
                for knowledge & conduct.
                Brahmans went to no other (caste),3
                nor did they buy their wives.
                Living together from mutual love,
                having come together, they found joy together.
                Aside from the time
                after menstruation,
                brahmans didn’t engage
                in copulation.
              
              
                They praised:
                the holy life, virtue,
                being straightforward, mild, austere,
                composed, harmless, enduring.
                The foremost brahman among them,
                firm in perseverance,
                didn’t engage in copulation
                even in a dream.
                Those imitating his practice
                praised the holy life, virtue,
                & endurance.
                They asked for rice, bedding, cloth,
                butter & oil.
                Having collected all that
                in line with rectitude,
                from that
                they performed the sacrifice.
                And in setting up the sacrifice,
                they didn’t harm cows.
              
              
                “Like a mother, father,
                brother, or other relative,
                cows are our foremost friends.
                From them comes medicine.
                They give food, strength,
                beauty, & happiness.”
              
              
                Knowing this line of reasoning,
                they didn’t harm cows.
                Delicate, with large bodies,
                beautiful, prestigious,
                brahmans were committed to standards
                of what should & shouldn’t be done
                in line with their principles.
                As long as this lasted in the world,
                humanity prospered in happiness.
              
              
                But a perversion came among them.
                Seeing, little by little,
                the splendor of kings—
                women well-ornamented,
                chariots yoked to thoroughbreds,
                well-made, with elaborate embroideries,
                houses & homes,
                well-proportioned, planned & laid out
                lavish human wealth,
                surrounded by circles of cows,
                joined with groups of excellent women—
                the brahmans grew greedy.
                Having composed chants there,
                they went up to Okkāka.
              
              
                “You have much wealth & grain.
                Sacrifice! Much is your property!
                Sacrifice! Much is your wealth!”
              
              
                Then the king, lord of charioteers,
                induced by the brahmans,
                having performed these sacrifices—
                the horse sacrifice, the human sacrifice,
                sammāpāsa, vājapeyya, & niraggaḷa4—
                gave the brahmans wealth:
                cows, bedding, clothes,
                women adorned,
                chariots yoked to thoroughbreds,
                well-made, with elaborate embroideries,
                Having had delightful homes,
                well-proportioned, filled throughout5
                with various grains,
                he gave the brahmans wealth.
              
              
                And they, receiving the wealth there,
                found joy together in hoarding it.
                Overcome by desire,
                their craving grew more.
                Having composed chants there,
                they went up to Okkāka again.
              
              
                “Like water & earth,
                gold, wealth, & grain,
                are cows to human beings.
                This is a requisite for beings.
                Sacrifice! Much is your property!
                Sacrifice! Much is your wealth!”
              
              
                Then the king, lord of charioteers,
                induced by the brahmans,
                killed in a sacrifice
                many hundred-thousands of cows.
                The cows—
                meek like sheep,
                giving milk by the bucket—
                hadn’t,
                with their hooves or horns or
                anything else, done
                anyone
                any harm.
                But the king,
                grabbing them by the horns,
                killed them with a knife.
              
              
                Then the devas, the Fathers,
                Indra, and rakkhasas
                cried out,
                “An injustice!”
                when the knife fell on the cows.
              
              
                Three were the diseases before then:
                desire, hunger, & aging.
                But from violence against cattle
                came ninety-eight.
                This injustice of violence
                has come down as ancient.
                The innocent are killed;
                the sacrificers fall away
                from the Dhamma.
              
              
                This tradition—ancient, vile—
                is criticized by the observant.
                Where people see such a thing,
                they criticize the sacrificer.
                With the Dhamma perishing in this way,
                merchants are split          from workers,
                noble warriors are split     far apart,
                the wife despises the husband.
                Noble warriors, kinsman of Brahmā,
                and any others protected by clan,
                repudiating the doctrine of their birth, fall
                under sensuality’s
                sway.
              
            
            When this was said, those brahmans of great means said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. We go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”

                and swept away in the current:
                How can he help others across?
              
              
                Even so:
                He who hasn’t
                cleared up the Dhamma,
                attended to the meaning
                of what the learned say,
                crossed over his own doubts:
                How can he get others
                to comprehend?
              
              
                But as one who’s embarked
                on a sturdy boat,
                with rudder & oars,
                would—thoughtful, skillful,
                knowing the needed techniques—
                carry many others across,
              
              
                even so
                an attainer-of-knowledge, learned,
                developed in mind,1 unwavering
                can get other people to comprehend—
                when the conditions have arisen
                for them to lend ear.
              
              
                So:
                You should befriend
                a person of integrity—
                learned, intelligent.
                Practicing so
                as to know the goal,
                when you’ve experienced the Dhamma,
              
              
                you get bliss.

              1. According to SnA, one’s superiors include those who have more wisdom than oneself, more skill in concentration and other aspects of the path than oneself, and those senior to oneself.
              2. SnA says that the right time to see a teacher is when one is overcome with passion, aversion, and delusion, and cannot find a way out on one’s own. This echoes a passage in AN 6:26, in which Ven. Mahā Kaccāna says that the right time to visit a “monk worthy of esteem” is when one needs help in overcoming any of the five hindrances or when one doesn’t yet have an appropriate theme to focus on to put an end to the mind’s effluents.
              3. SnA equates “words destructive of the Dhamma” with “animal talk.” See the discussion under Pācittiya 85 in The Buddhist Monastic Code.

Vaṅgīsa’s1 preceptor, an elder named Nigrodha Kappa, had recently totally unbound at the Aggāḷava shrine. Then as Ven. Vaṅgīsa was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in his awareness: “Has my preceptor totally unbound, or has he not totally unbound?”

From Vedic times it was customary to believe that divine beings had total vision of reality because they could see with all parts of their bodies—thus they were “all-around eyes.” At the same time, there was a belief that it was auspicious to gaze into a divine being’s eye, which meant that worshippers were content to see any part of the divine being’s body. Both of these beliefs carried over into Buddhist devotional practice. For more on this point, see DN 16, note 44.",", Jan Gonda, Eye and Gaze in the Veda.

              “I ask the sage of abundant discernment,
              crossed over to the far shore,
              totally unbound, steadfast in mind:
              Leaving home, rejecting sensuality,
              how does one wander rightly in the world?”1
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whoever’s omens are uprooted,
                as are meteors, dreams, & marks,2
                whose fault of omens is completely abandoned:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                A monk should subdue passion
                for sensualities human
                & even divine.
                Having gone past becoming,
                and met with the Dhamma,
                he would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Putting behind him
                divisive tale-bearing,
                a monk should abandon anger & meanness.
                With favoring & opposing
                totally abandoned,
                he would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Having abandoned dear & undear,
                independent—through no-clinging—of anything at all,
                fully released from fetters,
                he would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                He finds no essence in acquisitions,
                having subdued passion-desire for graspings,
                independent is he, by others unled:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Having rightly found the Dhamma,
                he is unobstructed in speech, mind, & act.
                Aspiring to unbinding,
                he would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                A monk who’d not gloat, “He venerates me,”
                or brood when insulted,
                or be elated on receiving food from another:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Fully abandoning greed & becoming,
                abstaining from cutting & binding (other beings),
                he, having crossed over doubt, de-arrowed,
                he would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Having found what’s appropriate for himself,
                the monk wouldn’t harm anyone in the world,
                Having found the Dhamma as it actually is,
                he would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                In whom there are no obsessions,
                his unskillful roots uprooted,
                with no longing, no
                expectations:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                His effluents ended, conceit abandoned,
                beyond reach of every road to passion,
                tamed, totally unbound, steadfast in mind:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Convinced, learned, having seen certainty,
                not following factions among those who are factious,
                enlightened; his greed, aversion, & irritation subdued:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Victorious, pure, his roof opened up,3
                a master of dhammas, gone beyond
                & unperturbed,
                skilled in the knowledge of fabrication-cessation:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Gone beyond speculations
                about futures & pasts,
                and—having passed by—
                purified in his discernment,
                fully released from all sense-media4:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Knowing          the state,
                meeting          the Dhamma,

                from the ending
                of all acquisitions:
                He would wander rightly in the world.”

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Dhammika the lay follower, together with 500 other lay followers, approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he addressed the Blessed One in verses:
            
              “I ask you, Gotama, Deeply Discerning:
              How-acting does one become a good disciple—
              either one gone from home into homelessness,
              or a lay follower with a home?
              
                For you discern the destination & future course
                of the world along with its devas
                —there is no one equal to you
                in seeing the subtle goal;
                for they call you foremost, awakened.
              
              
                Understanding all knowledge
                the whole Dhamma,1
                you proclaim it to beings with sympathetic mind.
                Your roof opened up,2 All-around Eye,3
                you, stainless, illumine the whole world.
              
              
                He came to your presence—
                Erāvaṇa, the nāga king,4
                having heard, ‘Conqueror.’
                Having consulted with you, having heard,
                he understood and, satisfied,
                (thought,) ‘Good.’
              
              
                And King Vessavaṇa Kuvera5
                came, inquiring about the Dhamma.
                To him, too, you spoke when asked.
                And he too, having heard, was satisfied.
              
              
                And these sectarians, debaters by habit,
                whether Ājīvakas or Nigaṇṭhas,
                don’t overtake you in terms of discernment,
                as a person standing
                doesn’t catch up
                with one going quickly.
              
              
                And these brahmans, debaters by habit,
                any elderly brahmans,
                and any others who consider themselves debaters,
                all depend on you for the meaning.
              
              
                For this Dhamma is subtle & blissful.
                This, Blessed One, well set-forth by you:
                We all want to hear it.
                Tell it to us, Excellent Awakened, when asked.
              
              
                All these monks are sitting together—
                and the lay followers, right there—to hear.
                Let them listen to the Dhamma
                awakened to by one who is stainless,
                as the devas listen to Vasavant’s6 well-spoken word.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Listen to me, monks. I will let you hear
                the Dhamma of polishing away. Live by it,7 all of you.
                May those who are thoughtful, seeing the purpose,
                partake of the duties proper for one gone forth.
              
              
                A monk should surely not wander
                at the wrong time.
                He should go for alms in the village
                at the right time.
                For attachments get attached to one going
                at the wrong time.
                That’s why they don’t wander at the wrong time,
                the awakened.
              
              
                Sights, sounds, tastes,
                smells, & tactile sensations
                intoxicate beings.
                Subduing desire for these things,
                one should, at the right time, enter for alms.
              
              
                Having received alms in proper season,
                a monk, returning alone, should sit down in solitude.
                Pondering what’s inside, his mind-state collected,
                he should not let his heart wander outside.
              
              
                If he should converse with a disciple,
                a monk, or anyone else,
                he should utter the exquisite Dhamma,
                and not divisive speech or disparagement of others.
              
              
                For some retaliate against arguments.
                We don’t praise those of limited discernment.
                Attachments get attached on account of this & that,
                for they send their minds far away from there.
              
              
                Having heard the Dhamma taught by the One Well-Gone,
                the disciple of foremost discernment, having considered it,
                should resort to almsfood, a dwelling, a place to sit & lie down,
                and water for washing dust from his robe.
              
              
                So a monk should stay unsmeared by these things—
                almsfood, a dwelling, a place to sit & lie down,
                and water for washing dust from his robe—
                like a water-drop on a lotus.
              
              
                As for the householder protocol,
                I will tell you how-acting
                one becomes a good disciple,
                since the entire monk-practice
                can’t be managed by those wealthy in property.
              
              
                Laying aside violence toward all living creatures,
                both the firm & unfirm in the world,
                one should not kill a living being, nor have it killed,
                nor condone killing by others.
              
              
                Then the disciple should avoid
                consciously (taking) what’s not given,
                —anything, anywhere—
                should not have it taken
                nor condone its taking.
                He should avoid all (taking of) what’s not given.
              
              
                The observant person should avoid uncelibate behavior
                like a pit of glowing embers.
                But if he’s incapable of celibate behavior,
                he should not transgress with the wife of another.
              
              
                When gone to an audience hall or assembly,
                or one-on-one, he should not tell a lie,
                nor have it told, nor condone it’s being told.
                He should avoid every untruth.
              
              
                Any householder who approves of this Dhamma
                should not take intoxicating drink,
                nor have others drink it, nor condone its being drunk,
                knowing that it ends in madness.
              
              
                For from intoxication, fools do evil things
                and get others, heedless, to do them.
                One should avoid this opening to demerit—
                madness, delusion—appealing to fools.
              
              
                One should not kill a living being,
                take what’s not given, tell a lie, nor be a drinker.
                One should abstain from uncelibate behavior—
                sexual intercourse—should not eat at night,
                a meal at the wrong time,
                should not wear a garland or use scents,
                should sleep on a bed, on the ground, or on a mat,
                For this, they say, is the eightfold uposatha,
                proclaimed by the Awakened One
                who has gone to the end of suffering & stress.
              
              
                Then, having kept, well-accomplished,
                the eightfold uposatha
                on the fourteenth, fifteenth, & eighth
                of the fortnight,8
                and on special days of the fortnight,
                with clear & confident mind,
                the observant person
                at dawn after the uposatha,
                confident, rejoicing,
                should share food & drink, as is proper,
                with the Saṅgha of monks.
              
              
                One should righteously support mother & father,
                should engage in righteous9 trade,
                One heedful in this householder protocol
                goes to the devas called

Sn 3:1  The Going Forth,Sn 3:1,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_1.html,"Sn 3:1  The Going Forth  —  The young Bodhisatta (Buddha-to-be), soon after leaving home, explains why he refuses King Bimbisāra’s offer of a position in his court.","KN/Sn/3:1
            
              I will praise the Going Forth,
              how he went forth, the One with Eyes,
              how he reasoned and chose the Going Forth.
              “Household life is confining,
              a realm of dust,
              while going forth
              is the open air.”
              Seeing this, he went forth.
              
                On going forth,
                he avoided evil deeds in body.
                Abandoning verbal misconduct,
                he purified his livelihood.
                Then he, the Buddha, went to Rājagaha,
                the mountain fortress of the Magadhans,
                and wandered for alms,
                teeming with the foremost marks.
                King Bimbisāra, standing in his palace, saw him,
                and on seeing him, consummate in marks,
                said this:
                “Look at this one, sirs.
                How handsome, stately, pure!
                How consummate his demeanor!
                Mindful, his eyes downcast,
                looking only a plow-length before him.
                This one’s not like one
                from a lowly lineage:
                Have the royal messengers hurry
                to see where this monk will go.”
              
              
                They—the messengers dispatched—
                followed behind him.
                “Where will this monk go?
                Where will his dwelling place be?”
                As he went from house to house—
                well-restrained, his sense-doors guarded,
                mindful, alert—
                his bowl filled quickly.
                Then he, the sage, completing his alms round,
                left the city, headed for Mount Paṇḍava.
                “That’s where his dwelling will be.”
                Seeing him go to his dwelling place,
                three messengers sat down,
                while one returned to tell the king.
                “That monk, your majesty,
                on the flank of Paṇḍava,
                sits like a tiger, a bull,
                a lion in a mountain cleft.”
              
              
                Hearing the messenger’s words,
                the noble-warrior king
                straight away set out by royal coach,
                for Mount Paṇḍava.
                Going as far as the coach would go,
                the noble-warrior king
                got down from the coach,
                went up on foot,
                and on arrival sat down.
                Sitting there,
                he exchanged courteous greetings,
                and after giving friendly greetings,
                said this:
                “Young you are, and youthful,
                in the first stage of youth,
                consummate in stature & coloring
                like a noble-warrior by birth.
                You would look glorious
                in the vanguard of an army,
                arrayed with an elephant squadron.
                I offer you wealth : Enjoy it.
                I ask your birth : Inform me.”
              
              
                “Straight ahead, your majesty,
                by the foothills of the Himalayas,
                is a country consummate
                in energy & wealth,
                inhabited by Kosalans:
                Solar by clan,
                Sakyans by birth.
                From that lineage I have gone forth,
                but not in hope of sensuality.
                Seeing the danger in sensuality
                —and renunciation as rest—
                I go to strive.
              
              
                That’s where my heart delights.”

              To me—
              my mind resolute in exertion
              near the river Nerañjarā,
              making a great effort,
              doing jhāna
              to attain rest from the yoke—
              
                Nāmuci1 came,
                speaking words of compassion:
                “You are ashen, thin.
                Death is in
                your presence.
                Death
                has 1,000 parts of you.
                Only one part
                is your life.
                Live, good sir!
                Life is better.
                Alive,
                you can do
                acts of merit.
                Your living the holy life
                and performing the fire sacrifice
                will heap up much merit.
                What use is exertion to you?
                Hard to follow
                —the path of exertion—
                hard to do, hard
                to sustain.”
              
              
                Saying these verses,
                Māra stood in the Awakened One’s presence.
                And to that Māra, speaking thus,
                the Blessed One
                said this:
              
              
                “Kinsman of the heedless,
                Evil One,
                come here for whatever purpose:
                I haven’t, for merit,
                even the least bit of need.
                Those who have need of merit:
                Those are the ones
                Māra’s fit to address.
              
              
                In me are
                conviction
                austerity,
                persistence,
                discernment.
                Why, when my mind is resolute,
                do you petition me
                to live?
                This wind could burn up
                even river currents.
                Why, when my mind is resolute,
                shouldn’t my blood dry away?
                As my blood dries up,
                gall & phlegm dry up,
                as muscles waste away,
                the mind grows clearer;

                concentration stand
                more firm.

                the mind has no interest
                in sensuality.

                Sixth     is called Cowardice.
                Your seventh     is Uncertainty.

                Gains, Offerings, Fame, & Status
                wrongly gained,

                & disparage others:
              
              
                That, Nāmuci, is your army,
                the Dark One’s commando force.
                A coward can’t defeat it,
                but one having defeated it
                gains bliss.
                Do I carry muñja grass?3
                I spit on my life.
                Death in battle would be better for me
                than that I, defeated,
                survive.4
              
              
                Sinking here, they don’t appear,
                some brahmans & contemplatives.
                They don’t know the path
                by which those with good practices
                go.

                May they not budge me
                from
                my spot.
                That army of yours,
                that the world with its devas
                can’t overcome,
                I will smash          with discernment—
                as an unfired pot     with a stone.

                doing my bidding—
                despite your wishes, will go
                where, having gone,
                there’s no grief.”
              
              
                Māra:
                “For seven years, I’ve dogged

                but haven’t gained an opening
                in the One Self-Awakened
                & glorious.
                A crow circled a stone

                but not getting anything delicious there,
                the crow went away.
                Like the crow attacking the rock,

                his lute fell from under his arm.
                Then he, the despondent spirit,
                right there
                disappeared.

              3. Muñja grass was the ancient Indian equivalent of a white flag. A warrior expecting that he might have to surrender would take muñja grass into battle with him. If he did surrender, he would lie down with the muñja grass in his mouth. The Buddha, in asking this rhetorical question, is indicating that he is not the type of warrior who would carry muñja grass. If defeated, he would rather die than surrender.

Sn 3:3  Well-spoken,Sn 3:3,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_3.html,Sn 3:3  Well-spoken  —  Four characteristics of well-spoken speech.,"KN/Sn/3:3
           I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There he addressed the monks, “Monks!”
            “Yes, lord,” the monks responded to him.
            The Blessed One said: “Monks, speech endowed with four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken—faultless & not to be faulted by the observant. Which four? There is the case where a monk says only what is well-spoken, not what is poorly spoken; only what is just, not what is unjust; only what is endearing, not what is unendearing; only what is true, not what is false. Speech endowed with these four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken—faultless & not to be faulted by the observant.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              The calm say that what is well-spoken is best;
              second, that one should say
              what is just, not unjust;
              third,          what’s endearing, not unendearing;
              fourth,          what is true, not false.
            
            Then Ven. Vaṅgīsa,1 rising from his seat, arranging his robe over one shoulder, faced the Blessed One with his hands palm-to-palm in front of his heart and said, “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, One Well-Gone!”
            “Let the inspiration come to you, Vaṅgīsa,” the Blessed One said.
            Then Ven. Vaṅgīsa praised the Blessed One to his face with these fitting verses:
            
              “Speak only the speech
              that neither torments self
              nor does harm to others.
              That speech is truly well-spoken.
              
                Speak only endearing speech,
                speech that is welcomed.
                Speech when it brings no evil
                to others
                is pleasant.
              
              
                Truth, indeed, is deathless speech:
                This is a primeval principle.
                The goal and the Dhamma
                —so say the calm—
                are firmly established on truth.
              
              
                The speech the Awakened One speaks,
                for attaining unbinding,
                rest,
                for making an end
                to the mass of stress:
                That is the speech unsurpassed.”

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kosalans on the bank of the River Sundarika. And on that occasion, the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja was offering a fire sacrifice and performing a fire oblation on the bank of the River Sundarika. Then, having offered the fire sacrifice and performed the fire oblation, he got up from his seat and looked around to the four directions, (thinking,) “Who should eat the remains of the offering?” He saw the Blessed One sitting not far away at the root of a tree with his head covered. On seeing him, he took the remains of the offering in his left hand and his water-pot in his right, and went to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, at the sound of the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja’s footsteps, uncovered his head. The brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja (thinking,) “This venerable one is shaven. This venerable one is a shaveling,” wanted to turn back. But then the thought occurred to him, “Still, there are some brahmans who are shaven. What if, having approached him, I were to ask his caste?”
            So he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, asked: “What is the venerable one’s birth-caste?”1
            Then the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja in verse:
            
              “I’m not a brahman or king’s son,
              not a merchant, or anyone at all.2
              Comprehending the clan
              of the run-of-the-mill,3
              having nothing,
              I wander by means of wisdom
              in the world.
              Wearing my outer robe,
              I wander without home,
              my hair     shaven off,
              my mind          entirely unbound,
              not adhering to people here.
              You ask me
              an inappropriate question
              about clan.”
              
                Sundarika:
                “But, sir, brahmans surely inquire of brahmans,
                ‘Are you among the brahmans?’”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “If you say you’re a brahman
                and I’m not a brahman,
                I ask you the three lines of the Sāvitti
                and its twenty-four syllables.”4
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “Because of what
                did seers, men, noble warriors, & brahmans
                —many of them here in the world—
                (first) arrange sacrifices to devas?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whoever has attained the end,
                an attainer-of-knowledge,
                should receive an oblation
                at the time of a sacrifice,
                his (sacrifice), I say, would succeed.”5
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “So yes, our sacrifice will succeed
                for we have seen an attainer-of-knowledge like you.
                It’s from not seeing those like you
                that someone else eats the sacrificial cake.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Therefore, brahman,
                as you are seeking your benefit,
                approach and ask.
                Perhaps you may find here
                one at peace, with no anger,
                no desire, no affliction:
                one with good wisdom.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “I delight in sacrifice,
                I desire to sacrifice,
                but I don’t understand
                where a sacrifice succeeds.
                Teach me, sir. Tell me that.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “In that case, brahman, lend ear.
                I will teach you the Dhamma.
                Don’t inquire about birth.6
                Inquire about conduct.
                As from wood, a fire is born,7
                so a sage, even from lowly birth
                —steadfast, restrained
                through a sense of shame—
                becomes a thoroughbred.
              
              
                One tamed by truth,
                endowed with self-control,
                attained to the end of knowledge,
                having fulfilled the holy life:
                To him, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,8
                to him a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those with well-restrained minds,
                straight as a shuttle:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those devoid of passion,
                their faculties well-centered,
                released like the moon
                from the grasp of an eclipse:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Unattached, they wander in the world,
                always mindful,
                abandoning possessiveness:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Who, abandoning sensuality,
                wanders victorious,
                who knows the end
                of birth & death,
                totally unbound, cool
                as a pool of water:
                The Tathāgata deserves9
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Consonant among the consonant,
                far from the discordant,
                the Tathāgata of infinite discernment,
                not smeared here or beyond:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                In whom no deceptiveness dwells,
                no conceit,
                devoid of greed, un-
                possessive, un-
                desiring,
                his anger dispelled,
                his mind entirely unbound,
                a brahman who has abandoned
                the stain of grief:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                He has abandoned the homes of the mind,
                has
                no possessions at all,
                no clinging here or beyond:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Centered, he’s crossed
                over the flood,
                he knows the Dhamma
                through the highest view,
                effluents ended, bearing his last body:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Whose effluent of becoming
                and harsh speech
                are destroyed, finished, do not exist—
                he, an attainer-of-knowledge,
                everywhere totally released10:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Gone beyond snares,
                for whom there are no snares,
                who, among those attached to conceit,
                is unattached to conceit,
                comprehending stress
                along with its field & its site11:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Independent of desire,
                seeing seclusion,12
                gone beyond the views known by others,
                who has
                no supports
                no mental objects13
                at all:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                In whom, having understood them,
                phenomena from high to low
                are destroyed, finished, do not exist14—
                at peace, released in the ending of clinging:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Seeing the end & ending
                of fetters & birth,
                having dispelled the path of passion
                without trace,
                pure, faultless, stainless, clear:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Who doesn’t contemplate
                self by means of self,15
                centered, straightened,
                steadfast in mind,16
                truly unperturbed,
                free from rigidity, free
                from doubt:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Who has no conditions for delusion,
                with knowledge & vision of all phenomena
                he carries his last body,
                having attained the unexcelled
                self-awakening, auspicious—
                to that extent is the purity of a spirit17:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “And may my offering
                be a true offering
                from having obtained
                an attainer-of-knowledge like you.
                As Brahmā is my witness,
                may the Blessed One accept,
                may the Blessed One eat,
                my sacrificial cake.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “What’s been chanted over with verses18
                shouldn’t be eaten by me.
                That’s not the nature, brahman,
                of one who’s seen rightly.
                What’s been chanted over with verses
                Awakened Ones reject.
                That being their Dhamma, brahman,
                this is their way of life.
                Serve with other food & drink
                a fully-perfected great seer,
                his effluents     ended,
                his anxiety     stilled,
                for that is the field
                for one looking for merit.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “It’s well, Blessed One, how I understand
                who should eat the offering of one like me,
                whom I should seek at the time of sacrifice
                having received your advice.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whose violence is fully gone,
                whose mind is     limpid,
                whose sloth is     dispelled
                —fully released from sensuality—
                one who has subdued boundaries,19
                a master of birth & death,
                a sage consummate in sagacity20:
                When one like this has come to the sacrifice,
                then, subduing scorn, with hands palm-to-palm
                over the heart,
                do homage.
                Worship him with food & drink.
                In this way the offerings will succeed.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “Master, the Awakened One,
                field of merit
                unexcelled          in all the world,
                recipient          for all the world21
                deserves          the sacrificial cake.
                A gift given to you, master,
                bears great fruit.
              
            
            Then the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One, “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in Master Gotama’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance (into the Bhikkhu Saṅgha).”
            Then the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sundarika Bhāradvāja became another one of the arahants.
            vv. 456–486",Another version of this encounter is recorded in SN 7:9.,"s
              1. The account in SN 7:9 goes immediately from this question to the Buddha’s response marked by footnote 6.
              2. See AN 4:36.
              3. According to SnA, the “clan” of the run-of-the-mill is the five aggregates. However, the clan of run-of-the-mill people might also refer to the customs of all lineages that don’t follow the customs of the noble lineage set out in AN 4:28. 
              4. This is apparently a reference to Ṛgveda iii, 62, 10, an invocation addressed to Sāvitrī, or the Sun: 
              
                tat savitur vareṇ(i)yaṁ
                bhargo devasya dhīmahi
                dhiyo yo nah pracodayāt
                
                  “Let us meditate on the glory
                  of the excellent deva Sāvitrī,
                  that he may inspire our thoughts.” 
                
              
              This verse, in the Gāvitrī meter, is recited during the upanayana ceremony, when a young brahman is invested with the sacred thread that initiates him into the status of a “twice-born” brahman and he begins his study of the Vedas. Although similar passages were recited when young men of other castes began their education, Ṛgveda iii, 62, 10 was reserved exclusively for brahmans. It was also the subject of many meditations on its esoteric meaning, some of which can be found in the major Upaniṣads: Bṛhad-āraṇyaka 6.3.6; śvetāśvatara 4.18; and Maitrī 6.7 and 6.34.
              SnA suggests that the Buddha’s question about this verse surprises Sundarika, making him suspect that the Buddha knows more about brahmanical lore than he does, which is why he changes his tone with the following question. SnA also asserts that the Buddhist equivalent to the Sāvitti—three lines, 24 syllables—is the expression of homage to the Triple Gem: Buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi, Dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi, Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.
              5. In other words, the original motivation for performing sacrifices was that the recipient of the oblation would be a pure person. The Buddha gives another answer to a very similar question in Sn 5:3.
              6. In SN 7:9, the Buddha’s initial response to Sundarika begins here.
              7. SnA explains this analogy by saying that it doesn’t matter what kind of wood is used to make a fire, for in each case the fire is equally hot and bright. See MN 93.
              8. In SN 7:9, the initial exchange between the Buddha and Sundarika ends here. Sundarika then offers the sacrificial cake to the Buddha, who refuses it with the passage beginning with the line marked by footnote 18. Then, as in Sn 1:4, he tells Sundarika to throw away the offering, which sizzles in the water into which it is thrown. Shocked, Sundarika returns to the Buddha, who teaches him five more verses of Dhamma.
              
                Don’t, brahman, when lighting kindling,
                imagine that purity comes from that outside,
                for the skilled say that purity doesn’t come through that:
                whoever searches outside for purity.
                Having abandoned the lighting of kindling, I,
                brahman, ignite just the inner fire.
                Constantly afire,
                constantly centered in mind,
                I am a worthy one, living the holy life.
                Conceit, brahman, is the burden on your shoulder,
                anger your smoke, false speech your ashes.
                The tongue is the ladle;
                the heart, the fire-altar;
                the well-tamed self
                is the fire of a man.
                The Dhamma is a lake
                whose ford is virtue
                —limpid, praised by the good
                to the good—
                where attainers-of-knowledge, having bathed
                cross, dry-limbed,
                to the further shore.
                Truth, Dhamma, restraint, the holy life,
                attainment of Brahmā dependent on the middle:
                Pay homage to those who’ve become
                truly straightened:
                That, I call a man
                in the flow of the Dhamma.
              
              After hearing these verses, Sundarika asks for Acceptance into the Saṅgha, and the sutta concludes in the same way as the account given here.
              9. This is a play on words: arahati, “deserves,” is related to arahant.
              10. On the implications of being “everywhere released,” see The Paradox of Becoming, chapter 7.
              11. According to SnA, the field and site of stress is a reference to defilements. It could also be a reference to the objects of clinging that can form a basis for stress: such things as the aggregates, sense media, and properties (dhātu).
              12. According to SnA, “seclusion” here means unbinding. See SN 21:10 and SN 35:63. 
              13. Supports/mental objects = ārammaṇā. See Ud 8:1, SN 12:64, and SN 22:53.
              14. On unbinding as the end of phenomena, see AN 10:58 and Sn 5:6.
              15. For examples of seeing self by means of self (or self by means of not-self, or not-self by means of self), see MN 2.
              16. This verse contains a play on words, in that attā can mean both “self” and “mind,” and it is used in both senses here.
              17. Spirit = yakkha. According to SnA, the word yakkha in this context means “person.” See Sn 4:11, note 4.
              18. See Sn 1:4.
              19. Boundaries = sīmantā. According to SnA, this is an epithet for defilement, in that the territory (sīmā) stands for good manners, and the end of the territory, or boundary, (sīmanta) stands for the defilements that lie outside of the realm of good manners. For a very different meaning for “territory,” see Sn 4:4, note 12.
              20. See AN 3:123 and Sn 1:12.
              21. The word, sabba-lokasmiṁ—”in all the world,” “with regard to all the world”—apparently functions as a lamp in this verse.",: SN 3:24; AN 6:37; AN 9:20
Sn 3:5  Māgha,Sn 3:5,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_5.html,Sn 3:5  Māgha  —  What are the qualities of a recipient that produce the most merit from a gift?,"KN/Sn/3:5
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain. Then the young brahman Māgha went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Master Gotama, I am generous, a master of giving, magnanimous, responsive to requests. I search for wealth righteously. Having searched for wealth righteously, then—with wealth righteously gained, righteously acquired—I give to one, I give to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, and to more. Thus giving, thus sacrificing, do I produce much merit?”
            “Certainly, young man, thus giving, thus sacrificing, you produce much merit. Anyone who is generous, a master of giving, magnanimous, responsive to requests, who searches for wealth righteously and, having searched for wealth righteously, then—with wealth righteously gained, righteously acquired—gives to one, to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, and to more, produces much merit.”
            Then the young brahman Māgha addressed the Blessed One in verse:
            
              “I ask the magnanimous Gotama,
              wearing ochre robes, wandering without home:
              When a householder responsive to requests,
              a master of giving,
              makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
              looking for merit,
              giving food & drink to others here,
              how is the offering purified
              for the one making the sacrifice?”
              
                The Buddha:
                “When a householder responsive to requests,
                a master of giving,
                makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
                looking for merit,
                giving food & drink to others here:
                Such a person achieves his aim
                in terms of the recipient.”
              
              
                Māgha:
                “When a householder responsive to requests,
                a master of giving,
                makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
                looking for merit,
                giving food & drink to others here:
                Point out to me the recipient.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Those who, unadhering,1
                wander in the world, having nothing,
                fully accomplished, their minds restrained:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those who have cut all fetters & bonds,
                tamed, released, with
                no afflictions,
                no desires:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those released from all fetters & bonds,
                tamed, released, with

                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Having abandoned
                passion, aversion, & delusion,
                their holy life fulfilled,
                their effluents ended:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those in whom no deceptiveness dwells,
                no conceit,
                their holy life fulfilled,
                their effluents ended:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those devoid of greed,
                unpossessive, undesiring,
                their holy life fulfilled,
                their effluents ended:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those who aren’t prey to cravings,
                who wander without possessiveness,
                having crossed over the flood:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those who, having abandoned sensuality,
                wander without home,
                their minds well-restrained,
                straight as a shuttle:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those devoid of passion,
                their faculties well-centered,
                released like the moon
                from the grasp of an eclipse:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Having calmed themselves,
                those devoid of passion, unprovoked,
                who have no (future) destinations,
                having abandoned them here:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Having abandoned birth & death
                without trace,
                they have escaped all perplexity:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                They who, with themselves as refuge,
                wander in the world,
                having nothing, everywhere released:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                They who know here, as it really is—
                ‘This is the last birth,
                there is no further becoming’:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                An attainer-of-knowledge,2
                delighting in jhāna, mindful,
                attained to self-awakening,
                the refuge of many:
                To him, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to him a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.”
                
              
              
                Māgha:
                “Yes, my question was not in vain.
                You, Blessed One, have pointed out the recipient.
                You know this here, as it really is,
                because this Dhamma has been experienced by you.
                When a householder responsive to requests,
                a master of giving,
                makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
                looking for merit,
                giving food & drink to others here:
                Point out to me, Blessed One,
                the consummation of the sacrifice.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Sacrifice, and while sacrificing, Māgha,
                said the Blessed One,
                make your mind clear          everywhere.
                For one sacrificing, the sacrifice is the object,
                the support.3
                Taking a stand there, he abandons faults.4
                He—devoid of passion, subduing aversion,
                developing a mind of goodwill
                immeasurable,
                day & night, continually heedful—
                should pervade all the directions
                immeasurably.”
              
              
                Māgha:
                “Who is purified? Released? Bound?
                By means of what mind does one go
                to the Brahmā world?
                Say this, sage, when asked
                by me who doesn’t know.
                As the Blessed One is my witness,
                I have seen Brahmā today,
                for you are equal to Brahmā for us—it’s true!
                How, shining one, does one reappear
                in the Brahmā world?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whoever sacrifices
                with the threefold sacrifice consummation,5
                such a one would achieve his aim
                in terms of the recipient.
                Having thus sacrificed rightly,
                one responsive to requests
                reappears, I say, in the Brahmā world.”5
              
            
            When this was said, the young brahman Māgha said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”
            vv. 487–509",No Introduction,"s
              1. Reading alaggā with the Thai edition. The Burmese and PTS editions read asattā, “without attachment.”
              2. In this verse, the Buddha is referring to himself.
              3. Support/object = ārammaṇaṁ.
              4. Dosa. There is apparently a play on words in this verse, with dosa meaning “fault” here, and “aversion” in the next line.
              5. According to SnA, the threefold consummation of the sacrifice refers to the three qualities of the donor mentioned in AN 6:37: “The donor, before giving, is glad; while giving, his/her mind is bright & clear; and after giving, is gratified.” However, because these qualities are not mentioned in this sutta, this explanation is unlikely. It’s more likely that the Buddha here is referring to the three points he made just above: that the donor should make his/her mind clear; should abandon the faults of passion and aversion; and should develop immeasurable thoughts of goodwill. For more on the development of immeasurable goodwill and its benefits, see MN 97, AN 4:125–126, AN 10:196, and AN 11:16.",: SN 3:24; SN 20:4; AN 5:53; AN 6:37; AN 8:54; AN 9:20; Iti 22; Iti 27; Iti 100
Sn 3:6  Sabhiya,Sn 3:6,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_6.html,"Sn 3:6  Sabhiya  —  A sutta dating from early in the Buddha’s teaching career. A wanderer, disappointed in the teachings he has received from other teachers, approaches the Buddha with his questions.","KN/Sn/3:6
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now on that occasion, questions had been assigned to Sabhiya the wanderer by a devatā who was a former relative of his: “Sabhiya, if any contemplative or brahman, when asked these questions, answers them, live the holy life in his presence.” Then Sabhiya the wanderer, having learned these questions in the presence of that devatā, went to those who had communities & groups, who were the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta, & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—and asked them the questions. But they, being asked the questions by Sabhiya the wanderer, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turned the questions back on Sabhiya the wanderer.
            The thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “These venerable contemplatives & brahmans with communities & groups, who are the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa … & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—when asked these questions by me are unable to answer. Unable to answer, they show anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turn the questions back on me. What if I were to revert to the lower life and partake of sensual pleasures?”
            But then the thought occurred to him, “There is still this Gotama the contemplative. He has a community & group, he is the teacher of a group, well-known, prestigious, founder of a sect, well-regarded by people at large. What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?”
            Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “Now, those venerable contemplatives & brahmans—Pūraṇa Kassapa … & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—are old, elderly, aged, along in their years, at an advanced stage of life, elders, senior, long gone forth, with communities & groups, teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large: Even they, when asked these questions by me, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turned the questions back on me. So how could this Gotama the contemplative answer when asked these questions? He is both young in age and newly gone forth.”
            But then the thought occurred to him, “Gotama the contemplative is not to be despised as ‘young’ or treated with contempt. Even though young, he is of great power & great might.1 What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?”
            So Sabhiya the wanderer set out, headed for Rājagaha. Wandering by stages, he arrived at where the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:
            
              “Doubtful & uncertain, I have come
              desiring to ask questions.
              Put an end to them,
              when asked them by me.
              Answer me     one-by-one,
              in line with the Dhamma.”
              
                “Sabhiya,” said the Blessed One,
                “you have come from afar,
                desiring to ask questions.
                I will put an end to them,
                when asked them by you.
                I will answer you     one-by-one,
                in line with the Dhamma.”
              
            
            Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “Isn’t is amazing? Isn’t it astounding?—how even the leave, of which I didn’t receive even a little bit from other contemplatives & brahmans, has been granted to me by Gotama the contemplative.” Gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, & happy, he asked the Blessed One a question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be a monk?
              In what way is one composed?
              And how is one said to be tamed?
              How is one called ‘awakened’?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having gone to total unbinding,
                having crossed over doubt,
                by means of the path accomplished by himself,
                having abandoned becoming & non-becoming,
                having fulfilled [the task],
                further-becoming ended:
                He is a monk.2
              
              
                Everywhere equanimous, mindful,
                he harms no one in all the world.
                A contemplative crossed over, limpid,
                he has no swellings3: He is composed.
              
              
                Whose faculties are developed,
                within & without,
                with regard to all the world,4
                disenchanted with this world & the next,
                he awaits his time,5 developed: He’s tamed.
              
              
                Having evaluated all theories,
                the wandering-on,
                dying & reappearing,
                having done away with dust & blemish
                —pure—
                he has attained the ending of birth:
                He is called awakened.”6
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be a brahman?
              In what way is one a contemplative,
              and how is one ‘washed’?
              How is one called a nāga?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having banished all evils,7
                well-centered, stainless,
                firm in mind,
                gone entirely          beyond
                the wandering-on,
                independent, Such:
                He’s called a brahman.
              
              
                Calmed, having abandoned
                good & evil,
                dustless, having known
                this world & the next,
                gone beyond birth & death,
                he is truly called a contemplative8—
                Such.
              
              
                Having washed off     all evils
                within & without, in     all the world,
                with regard to the theories
                of beings human & divine,
                he goes to no theory:
                He’s said to be ‘washed.’9
              
              
                He does no misdeed10
                at all in the world.
                Having escaped all fetters & bonds,
                freed, he’s everywhere un-
                attached,
                truly he’s called a nāga—
                Such.”
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Whom do the awakened
              call a field-victor?
              In what way is one skilled
              and how is one wise?
              And how is one called
              by the name of ‘sage’?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having examined all fields11—
                heavenly, human, and fields of the Brahmās—
                freed from the root bonds of all fields,
                he’s truly called a field-victor—
                Such.
              
              
                Having examined all storehouses12—
                heavenly, human, storehouses of Brahmās—
                freed from the root bonds of all storehouses,
                he’s truly called skillful—
                Such.
              
              
                Having examined all white flowers13
                within & without,
                one of pure discernment
                gone beyond dark & bright,
                he’s truly called wise—
                Such.
              
              
                Knowing false & true Dhamma
                within & without, in all the world,
                he is worshipped by beings
                human & divine.
                Having transcended snares & nets,
                he is a sage.”
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be
              an attainer-of-knowledge?
              In what way is one well-tested,
              and how is one persistent?
              Why is one named a thoroughbred?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having examined all knowledges—
                those of brahmans, those of contemplatives—
                devoid of passion for all feelings,14
                gone beyond knowledge:
                He’s an attainer-of-knowledge.
              
              
                Having tested objectification15
                & name-&-form,
                within & without, the root of disease,
                freed from the root bond of disease,
                he’s truly called well-tested—
                Such.
              
              
                Abstaining from all evils,
                gone beyond the suffering of hell,
                he’s one with persistence.
                He, with persistence, exertion,
                is rightly called a hero16—
                Such.
              
              
                One truly whose bonds are cut
                within & without,
                freed from all the root bonds of snares,
                truly he’s called a thoroughbred—
                Such.”
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be learned?
              In what way is one noble,
              and how is one a person of good conduct?
              Why is one named a wanderer?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having heard, having directly known
                every Dhamma
                for the sake of direct knowing17
                in the world,
                whatever is blameworthy or blameless,
                having conquered, free of doubt,
                released
                everywhere, everywhere
                without trouble,
                one is said to be learned.18
              
              
                Having cut attachments & effluents,
                knowing, he does not come to lie in the womb,
                dispelling mud
                and the three types of perception,19
                he goes to no theory:
                He is called noble.
              
              
                Whoever here has attained attainment
                with regard to good conduct,
                all-skillful, who has learned the Dhamma,
                unattached
                everywhere,
                everywhere his mind released,
                he has no irritation:
                He is one of good conduct.
              
              
                Avoiding whatever action there is
                that ripens in suffering & stress
                —above, below, and even all around
                in the middle—
                one who goes about, comprehending,
                he has put an all-around end to
                deceptiveness, conceit,
                greed, anger,
                name-&-form:
                He’s called a wanderer,
                attained to attainment.”20
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy—got up from his seat and, arranging his upper robe over his shoulder and placing his hands palm-to-palm over his heart toward the Blessed One, praised the Blessed One face-to-face with fitting verses:
            
              “One Deeply Discerning,
              you have crossed over the flood of darkness
              of the three & sixty views leading downward,21
              dependent on the teachings of contemplatives,
              dependent on perceptions
              & words of perceptions.
              You have gone     to the end,
              you have gone     to the further shore
              of suffering & stress.
              You are a noble one,
              rightly self-awakened.
              I would imagine that you
              have ended the effluents.
              Brilliant, thoughtful,
              of abundant discernment,
              ender of suffering,
              you have brought me across.
              
                When you learned of my doubt,
                you brought me across my uncertainty.
                Homage to you, sage attained
                to the attainment of sagacity’s ways.
                Free from rigidity, Kinsman of the Sun,
                you’re composed.
              
              
                The doubt I had before,
                you have answered, One with Eyes.
                Yes, you are a sage, rightly
                self-awakened. You have
                no hindrances. Your despairs
                are fallen down, cut from the stem.
                Cooled, attained to self-control,
                steadfast, enduring in truth:
                In your words, Nāga of nāgas, great hero,
                all devas—including Nāradas and Pabbatas22—
                delight.
                Homage to you, O thoroughbred man,
                Homage to you, O superlative man,23
                in the world with its devas
                there’s no one to compare with you.24
                You : Awakened.
                You : Teacher.
                You : Sage who has conquered Māra.
                You : Having cut obsessions,
                having crossed over,
                bring this generation across.
                Your acquisitions transcended,
                your effluents torn apart,
                you are a lion
                free of clinging,
                your fear & terror abandoned.
                As a lovely lotus
                is not smeared by water,
                you are not smeared
                by good or evil.
              
              
                Extend your feet, hero:
                Sabhiya venerates them,
                the feet of the Teacher.25
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer, bending his head to the Blessed One’s feet, said, “Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance.”
            “Anyone, Sabhiya, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the Going-forth & Acceptance into this Dhamma & Vinaya, must first undergo probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks feel so moved, they give him the Going-forth & accept him into the monk’s state. But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter.”
            “Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end of four years, the monks feel so moved, let them give me the Going-forth & accept me into the monk’s state.”
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sabhiya became another one of the arahants.
            vv. 510–547",No Introduction,"s
              1. Reading Daharo’pi c’esa samaṇo Gotamo mahiddhiko hoti mahānbhavo, with the Burmese edition.
              2. Many of the Buddha’s answers to Sabhiya’s questions involve verbal effects such as alliteration and rhyme. This verse contains a play on words, relating bhikkhu (monk) to bhavaṁ (becoming) and khīṇa- (ended).
              3. Ussada: According to SnA, this means such forms of defilement as passion, aversion, delusion, pride, and conceit. See Sn 4:14.
              4. In other words, one who is dispassionate to the sense faculties and their objects. See SN 35:153.
              5. This is a reference to an image more fully elaborated in Thag 11 and Thag 14:1:
              
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time
                as a worker his wage.
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time,
                mindful, alert.
              
              6. This verse contains an end-rhyme—visuddhaṁ/Buddhaṁ—which is rare in Pali poetry.
              7. Here there is alliteration between bāhetvā (banished) and brahmā (brahman, shortened to fit the meter). A similar alliteration is found in Dhp 388 and Ud 1:4–5.
              8. Here there is alliteration between samitāvi (calmed) and samaṇo (contemplative).
              9. Here there is alliteration between n’eti, “doesn’t come/go” and nhātako, “washed.” This verse also contains a play on words. Normally, one would say that a person is washed of dirt (uklāpa); here the arahant is said to be washed of theory (kappa).
              10. The Pali phrase here is āguṁ na karoti, which could be rephrased as na āguṁ karoti, yielding a play on the word nāga. The same play on words is found in AN 6:43. Given that one of the meanings of nāga is “large elephant,” the verse here further elaborates on the image evoked by the word by depicting the nāga as freed from all fetters and bonds.
              11. SnA cites this passage from AN 3:77 to identify “field,” here, with kamma: “Kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture.” In the context of that sutta, this analogy is used to explain the way different levels of becoming are produced.
              12. As with “field,” SnA identifies “storehouses” as storehouses of kamma. Here there is alliteration between kosāni (storehouses) and kusalo (skillful).
              13. Paṇḍara = Pāṇdura (Skt.): Anogeissus Latifolia. According to SnA, “white flowers” stands for the six sense media, in that they are normally pure and yet can grow (see SN 22:54). An alternative possibility is that “white flowers” stands for states of mind marked by a perception of whiteness—such as the white-totality, and the mastery described in AN 10:29 as follows: 
              

                “One percipient of the formless internally sees forms externally as white, white in their color, white in their features, white in their glow. Just as the morning star is white, white in its color, white in its features, white in its glow, or just as Vārāṇasī muslin, smooth on both sides, is white, white in its color, white in its features, white in its glow, in the same way one percipient of the formless internally sees forms externally as white, white in their color, white in their features, white in their glow. Mastering them, he is percipient of ‘I know; I see.’”
              
              As AN 10:29 further notes, this is the highest state of mastery, “yet even in the beings who are percipient in this way there is still aberration, there is change. Seeing this, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with that. Being disenchanted with that, he becomes dispassionate toward what is supreme, and even more so toward what is inferior.” As the verse here notes, a person going beyond this state would have to go beyond all states of darkness and brightness to attain release.
              This verse contains an alliteration that can, without force, be replicated in English: white flowers (paṇdarāni) and wise (paṇdito).
              14. Here there is a play on words with vedāni (knowledges) and vedanā (feelings).
              15. See MN 18, introduction.
              16. Reading vīro with GD, rather than dhīro, which is found in the printed editions but doesn’t seem to fit the context. (See the note in GD to verse 44 in Sn 1:3, which comments on the tendency of the textual tradition to confuse these two words.) This reading would give the verse three alliterated words: virato (abstaining), viriyavā (one with persistence), and vīro (hero).
              17. “Having directly known, for the sake of direct knowing”: Two meanings of the word abhiññāya.
              18. Here there is an alliteration between sutavā (having heard) and sottiyo (learned). 
              19. SnA identifies “mud” as the strings of sensuality, and the three types of perception as the three beginning with the perception of sensuality. These could be either the perceptions of sensuality, ill-will, and harmfulness, or the perceptions of sensuality, form, and formlessness.
              The alliteration in this verse is between ālayāni (attachments) and ariyo (noble).

            I have heard that on one occasion, while the Blessed One was wandering on a tour among the Aṅguttarāpans with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all, he arrived at an Aṅguttarāpan town named Āpaṇa. Keṇiya the coiled hair ascetic heard it said, “Gotama the contemplative—a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan—on a wandering tour among the Aṅguttarāpans with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all—has arrived at Āpaṇa. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: ‘He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed. He makes known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its rulers & commonfolk; he explains the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; he expounds the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.’”
            So Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side.1 As he was sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged him with a talk on Dhamma. Then Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic—instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged with the Blessed One’s talk on Dhamma—said to him, “Master Gotama, may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of monks.”
            When this was said, the Blessed One said to him, “The Saṅgha of monks is large, Keṇiya, approximately 1,250 monks in all, and you are strongly confident in brahmans.”
            A second time… A third time, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic said to the Blessed One, “Master Gotama, even though the Saṅgha of monks is large, approximately 1,250 monks in all, and I am strongly confident in brahmans, may Master Gotama acquiesce to my meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of monks.”
            The Blessed One acquiesced with silence.
            Then Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, understanding the Blessed One’s acquiescence, got up from his seat and returned to his own ashram. On arrival, he addressed his friends & companions, his relatives & kinsmen: “Listen to me, venerable friends & companions, relatives & kinsmen: I have invited Gotama the contemplative together with a Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all, for the meal tomorrow. Give me bodily assistance for that.”
            “As you say, master,” his friends & companions, relatives & kinsmen responded to him. Some of them dug out ovens, some split wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water pot, some arranged seats, while Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic arranged a pavilion of garlands himself.
            Now on that occasion Sela the brahman was staying at Āpaṇa. He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, etymology, & histories as a fifth; skilled in philology & grammar, he was fully versed in cosmology and in the marks of a Great Man. He was instructing 300 young brahmans in the (Vedic) mantras. Then, as he—surrounded by 300 young brahmans—was walking and wandering about to exercise his legs, he arrived at the ashram of Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic. He saw that some of the people in the ashram were digging out ovens, some were splitting wood… while Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic was arranging a pavilion of garlands himself. On seeing this, he said to Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, “Could it be that Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic is giving a son or daughter in marriage, or is he setting up a great sacrifice, or is Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, invited for tomorrow together with his army?”
            “No, Sela, it’s not that I’m giving a son or daughter in marriage, nor that Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, is invited for tomorrow together with his army. But I am setting up a great sacrifice. There is Gotama the contemplative—a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan—who, on a wandering tour among the Aṅguttarāpans with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all, has arrived at Āpaṇa. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: ‘He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.’ He has been invited by me for the meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of monks.”
            “Did you say, ‘Awakened,’ master Keṇiya?”
            “I said, ‘Awakened,’ master Sela.”
            “Did you say, ‘Awakened,’ master Keṇiya?”
            “I said, ‘Awakened,’ master Sela.”
            Then the thought occurred to Sela the brahman, “Even just this word is hard to come by in the world: ‘Awakened.’ Now, these 32 marks of a Great Man have come down in our mantras. For a Great Man endowed with them, two future courses, and no other, exist. If he inhabits a home, he will become a wheel-turning king, righteous, a king through righteousness, a conqueror of the four quarters, a stabilizer of his countryside endowed with the seven treasures. The seven treasures are these: the wheel-treasure, the elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the woman-treasure, the householder-treasure, and the adviser-treasure as the seventh. He will have a thousand sons, valiant, heroic in body, crushers of enemy armies. He will dwell, having conquered the earth to the edge of the sea, by means of Dhamma, without rod, without sword. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he will become a worthy one, rightly self-awakened, with his roof opened in the world.”2
            “Master Keṇiya, where is he staying now, that Master Gotama, worthy & rightly self-awakened?”
            When this was said, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic lifted his right arm and said to Sela the brahman, “There, by the dark green line of the forest.”
            Then Sela the brahman, together with the 300 young brahmans, headed toward the Blessed One. Then he addressed the young brahmans, “Come noiselessly, masters, placing a footstep in a footstep. These Blessed Ones are hard to approach, like a lion wandering alone. And when I engage Gotama the contemplative in counsel, don’t break into the middle of my talk. Wait until the end of my talk.”
            Then Sela the brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he looked for the 32 marks of a Great Man in the Blessed One’s body. He saw most of the 32 marks of a Great Man in the Blessed One’s body, except for two. About the two marks he was doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and wasn’t reassured: about the male organ being in a sheath, and about the size of the tongue.
            The thought occurred to the Blessed One, “Sela the brahman sees most of my marks of a Great Man, except for two. About the two marks he is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and isn’t reassured: about the male organ being in a sheath, and about the size of the tongue.” So the Blessed One willed a willing of power such that Sela the brahman saw that the Blessed One’s male organ was in a sheath. And then, extending his tongue, the Blessed One licked both ear-holes and nostrils back and forth, and covered his whole forehead with his tongue.
            The thought occurred to Sela the brahman, “Gotama the contemplative’s 32 marks of a Great Man are complete and not incomplete. But I don’t know whether he is awakened or not. Still, I have heard the aged line of teachers, along in their years, say that Blessed Ones, worthy & rightly self-awakened, reveal themselves when their praise is spoken. What if I were to praise Gotama the contemplative face-to-face with fitting verses?”
            So Sela the brahman praised the Blessed One face-to-face with fitting verses:
            
              “Perfect your body, shining well,
              well-born, lovely to look at,
              Blessed One, you have a golden complexion,
              you have white teeth, you’re vigorous.
              The characteristics of a well-born man,
              the marks of a Great Man,
              are all present in your body.
              Clear your eyes, good your face,
              imposing, splendid, straight upright:
              In the midst
              of a community of contemplatives
              you shine like the sun.
              A monk with skin resembling gold
              is admirable to look at,
              but what use is the contemplative state
              for you, so superlative in appearance?
              You deserve to be a king,
              a wheel-turner,3 lord of charioteers,
              conqueror of the four quarters,
              sovereign lord of the Jambu grove.4
              Noble warriors, feudal lords, & kings
              are your devotees.
              King of kings, monarch of human beings:
              Rule, Gotama!”
              
                The Buddha:
                “I am a king, Sela:
                a Dhamma king unexcelled.
                I turn the wheel with Dhamma—
                the wheel whose turning
                can’t be stopped.”
              
              
                Sela:
                “You claim to be rightly self-awakened,
                a Dhamma king unexcelled.
                But who, master, is your general,
                the disciple right below the teacher?
                Who keeps rolling
                the Dhamma-wheel set rolling by you?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “The wheel set rolling by me
                the unexcelled Dhamma-wheel:
                Sāriputta keeps it rolling
                taking after the Tathāgata.5
                What should be directly known
                has been directly known,
                what should be developed, developed,
                what should be abandoned, abandoned6:
                Therefore, I’m awakened, brahman.
                Subdue your doubt about me.
                Be decided, brahman.
                It’s hard often to gain
                sight of the Rightly Self-Awakened.
                I am one
                whose appearance in the world
                is hard often to gain:
                Rightly Self-Awakened,
                an arrow-remover unexcelled.
                Brahmā-become, without compare,
                crusher of Māra’s armies,
                having overmastered all enemies,
                I rejoice, with no fear
                from anywhere.”
              
              
                Sela (to his following):
                “Observe carefully, masters,
                how he speaks, this One with Eyes,
                arrow-remover, great hero:
                He roars like a lion in the forest.
                Brahmā-become, without compare,
                crusher of Māra’s armies:
                Who,
                even one of a dark birth,7
                on seeing him,
                would not have confidence?
                Whoever wants to     may follow me.
                Whoever doesn’t     may go.
                I will here go forth
                in the presence of the one
                of foremost discernment.”
              
              
                Sela’s following:
                “If, master, you thus delight
                in the message
                of the Rightly Self-Awakened One,
                we, too, will here go forth
                in the presence of the one
                of foremost discernment.”
              
              
                Sela:
                “These three hundred brahmans
                request, with hands palm-to-palm
                over the heart:
                We will follow the holy-life,
                Blessed One, in your presence.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “The holy-life is well-expounded,
                to be seen here-&-now, timeless,
                where the Going-forth is not in vain
                for a heedful person who trains.”
              
            
            Then Sela the brahman, together with his following, obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance.
            Then, as the night was ending, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, having had choice staple & non-staple foods prepared in his own ashram, announced the time to the Blessed One, “It is time, master Gotama. The meal is ready.”
            Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One—after adjusting his lower robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe—went together with a Saṅgha of monks to Keṇiya’s ashram. On arrival, he sat down on an arranged seat. Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, with his own hand, served & satisfied the Blessed One & the Saṅgha of monks with choice staple & non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had rinsed his bowl & hands, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic took a lower seat and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One expressed approval of him with these verses:
            
              “The fire oblation is the chief of sacrifices,
              the Sāvitti,     the chief of Vedic hymns,8
              a king,          chief among human beings,
              the ocean,     chief among rivers,
              the moon,     chief of the zodiac stars,
              the sun,          chief of things that burn,9
              and for those who sacrifice, wishing for merit,
              the Saṅgha, truly,
              is chief.
            
            Then, having expressed approval of Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic with these verses, the Blessed One got up from his seat and left.
            Then Ven. Sela, together with his following—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sela, together with his following, became another one of the arahants.
            Then Ven. Sela, together with his following, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and extending his hands palm-to-palm over the heart toward the Blessed One, addressed him in verse:
            
              “This is the eighth day
              since coming for refuge,
              One with Eyes.
              Blessed One,
              for seven nights,
              we have tamed ourselves
              with your message.
              You : Awakened.
              You : Teacher.
              You : Sage who has conquered Māra.
              You : Having cut obsessions,
              having crossed over,
              bring this generation across.
              Your acquisitions transcended,
              your effluents torn apart,
              you are a lion
              free of clinging,
              your fear & terror abandoned.
              These three hundred monks
              stand with hands palm-to-palm
              over the heart.
              Extend your feet, hero:
              The nāgas venerate them,
              the feet of the Teacher.”10
            
            vv. 548–573", (This sutta is identical with MN 92. Part of it also appears in Mv VI.35.1–8.),"s
              1. According to Mv VI.35.3, at this point in the narrative Keṇiya offered a juice drink to the Buddha, who told him also to offer the drink to the Saṅgha. This became the occasion for the allowance for monks to consume juice drinks after noon.
              2. See Sn 1:2, note 3.
              3. To be a wheel-turner meant, in ancient Indian parlance, to establish rule over the entire “wheel” of the eight directions. The sutta containing the Buddha’s first sermon (SN 56:11), in stating that the sermon set the Dhamma-wheel rolling, thus borrowed this image to make the point that the Buddha’s Dhamma ruled in all directions.
              The Dhamma-wheel is also a wheel in another sense. In ancient Indian texts, a “wheel” was a list of a permutations of two or more variables. The Dhamma-wheel in the Buddha’s first sermon lists all twelve permutations of two variables: the four noble truths—stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation—and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed.
              4. An epithet for the Indian subcontinent.
              5. See MN 141. MLDB, in its translation of this verse in MN 92, mistakenly says that Sāriputta will keep the Dhamma wheel rolling; GD mistakenly identifies him as the Buddha’s successor, rather than as the disciple right below him. Translations of this sort have led at least one scholar to cite this verse as a late addition to the Canon, in conflict with MN 108, which clearly states that the Buddha left no successor, and with SN 47:13, which notes that Sāriputta passed away before the Buddha. However, when the verse is correctly translated, there is no conflict. 
              6. Three of the four duties with regard to the four noble truths. See SN 56:11 and MN 149.
              7. Sela, despite his newfound confidence in the Buddha, has not yet abandoned his racism. In AN 4:85, however, the Buddha redefines the brahmanical concept of dark birth in such a way that is based on kamma rather than race.
              8. Chandas. This term normally means “meter,” but it also means Vedic hymn. See the discussion in The Buddhist Monastic Code, volume II, chapter 8. On the Sāvitti as the chief Vedic hymn, see Sn 3:4, note 4.
              9. See Dhp 387.

                gone to the other world,
                father cannot shelter son,
                nor relatives a relative.
                See: Even while relatives are looking on,
                wailing heavily,
                mortals are
                one
                by
                one
                led away
                like cows to the slaughter.
                In this way is the world afflicted
                with aging & death,
                and so the enlightened don’t grieve,
                knowing the way of the world.
              
              
                “You don’t know the path
                of his coming or going:
                seeing neither end,
                you lament in vain.”2
              
              
                If, by lamenting,
                —confused,
                harming yourself—
                any use could be gained
                the prudent would do it as well.
                But not by weeping & grief
                do you gain peace of awareness.
                Pain
                arises all the more. Your body
                is harmed.
                You grow thin,
                pale,
                harming yourself
                by yourself.
                Not in that way
                are the dead protected.
                Lamentation’s in vain.
                Not abandoning grief, a person
                suffers all the more pain.
                Bewailing one whose time is done,
                you fall under the sway of grief.
              
              
                Look at others
                going along,
                people arriving
                in line with their actions:
                falling under the sway of death,
                beings simply
                shivering here.
              
              
                For however they imagine it,
                it always turns out
                other than that.
                That’s the type of (their) separation.
                See the way of the world.
              
              
                Even if a person lives a century
                —or more—
                he’s parted
                from his community of relatives,
                he abandons his life
                right here.
              
              
                So, having heard the arahant,
                subduing lamentation,
                seeing the dead one whose time is done,
                [think,] “I can’t fetch him back.”3
                Just as one would put out
                a burning refuge
                with water,
                so does the enlightened one—
                discerning,
                skillful,
                & wise—
                blow away any arisen grief,
                like the wind, a bit of cotton fluff.
              
              
                Seeking your own happiness,
                you should pull out your own arrow:
                your own
                lamentation,
                longing,
                & sorrow.4
                With arrow pulled out,
                independent,
                attaining peace of awareness,
                all grief transcended,
                griefless you are
                unbound.

Sn 3:9  Vāseṭṭha,Sn 3:9,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_9.html,"Sn 3:9  Vāseṭṭha  —  Is one worthy of respect because of one’s birth, or because of one’s actions?","KN/Sn/3:9
           
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Icchānaṅgala in the Icchānaṅgala forest grove. And on that occasion many well-known wealthy brahmans were dwelling in Icchānaṅgala, i.e., Caṅkī the brahman, Tārukkha the brahman, Pokkharasāti the brahman, Jānusoṇin the brahman, Todeyya the brahman, and many other well-known wealthy brahmans.
            Then, while the young brahmans Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking and wandering about to exercise their legs, this conversation arose between them: “How is one a brahman?”
            The young brahman Bhāradvāja said, “When one is well-born on both sides, the mother’s & the father’s, is of pure descent for seven generations of fathers—uncriticized & irreproachable in the telling of one’s birth: It’s to that extent that one is a brahman.”
            The young brahman Vāseṭṭha said, “When one is virtuous & consummate in one’s practices, it’s to that extent that one is a brahman.”
            But neither was the young brahman Bhāradvāja able to win over the young brahman Vāseṭṭha, nor was the young brahman Vāseṭṭha able to win over the young brahman Bhāradvāja.
            Then the young brahman Vāseṭṭha said to the young brahman Bhāradvāja, “Bhāradvāja, this Gotama the contemplative—a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan—is staying at Icchānaṅgala in the Icchānaṅgala forest grove. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: ‘He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to Gotama the contemplative and, on arrival, ask him about this matter. However he answers, that’s how we’ll hold it.”
            “As you say, master,” the young brahman Bhāradvāja responded to the young brahman Vāseṭṭha. So the young brahmans Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, the young brahman Vāseṭṭha addressed the Blessed One in verses:
            
              Master, we’re acknowledged & self-proclaimed
              as masters of the three knowledges1:
              I, a student of Pokkharasāti,
              this one, of Tārukka.
              Whatever is taught
              by masters of the three knowledges,
              in that we are adept—
              grammarians & philologists,
              on a par with our teachers in recitation.
              
                We have a dispute, Gotama,
                on the topic of birth.
                Bhāradvāja says that one is a brahman
                through birth,
                I say through action.2
                Know this, One with Eyes.
                Neither of us can win over the other.
                We come, asking the master
                reputed to be self-awakened.
                As people going
                with hands palm-to-palm over the heart
                pay homage, venerating
                the moon when it’s just past new,
                in the same way in the world, Gotama,
                we ask Gotama, the Eye arisen in the world:
                Is one a brahman through birth
                or is it through action?
                Tell us, who don’t know,
                how we might know a brahman.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “I will answer you step-by-step
                as it really is.
                Animals are divided by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.3
                You know grasses & trees,
                even though they don’t proclaim themselves:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                Then beetles & moths, down to white ants:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                You know four-footed beasts,
                small & large:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                You know belly-footed, long-backed snakes:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                Then you know fish in the water, with water their range:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                Then you know birds, with wings as their vehicles,
                coursing through the sky:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
              
              
                While these species
                have many distinguishing marks
                made by nature,
                human beings     don’t
                have many distinguishing marks
                made by nature:
                not through hair or head
                not through ears or eyes,
                not through face or nose,
                not through mouth or lips,
                not through neck or shoulders,
                not through belly or back,
                not through buttocks or chest,
                not through groin or intercourse,
                not through hands or feet,
                not through fingers or nails,
                not through calves or thighs,
                not through complexion or voice.
                Their distinguishing mark is not made by nature
                as it is for other species.
                In human beings that’s not found
                individually in their bodies,
                but their identification is described
                in terms of convention:
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living by guarding cows,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a farmer, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through various crafts,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a craftsman, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through trade,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a merchant, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living by serving others,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a servant, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through stealing,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha:
                This is a thief, not a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through arrow & sword,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a soldier, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through priesthood,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a sacrificer, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living partaking of city & state,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a king, not as a brahman.
              
              
                
                  I don’t call one a brahman
                  for being born of a mother
                  or sprung from a womb.
                  He’s called a ‘bho-sayer’
                  if he has anything at all.
                  But someone with nothing,
                  who clings to no thing:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.4
                  Having cut every fetter,
                  he doesn’t get ruffled.
                  Beyond attachment,
                  unshackled:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having cut the strap & thong,
                  cord & bridle,
                  having thrown off the bar,5
                  awakened:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He endures—unangered—
                  insult, assault, & imprisonment.
                  His army is strength;
                  his strength, forbearance:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Free from anger,
                  duties observed,
                  principled, with no overbearing pride,
                  trained, a ‘last-body’:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.6
                  Like water          on a lotus leaf,
                  a mustard seed     on the tip of an awl,
                  he doesn’t adhere     to sensual pleasures:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He discerns right here,
                  for himself,
                  on his own,
                  his own
                  ending of stress.7
                  Unshackled, his burden laid down:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Wise, deeply
                  discerning, astute
                  as to what is the path
                  & what’s not;
                  his ultimate goal attained:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Uncontaminated
                  by householders
                  & houseless ones alike;
                  living with no home,
                  with next to no wants:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having put aside violence
                  against beings fearful or firm,
                  he neither kills nor
                  gets others to kill:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Unopposing          among opposition,
                  unbound          among the armed,
                  unclinging          among those who cling:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  His passion, aversion,
                  conceit, & contempt,
                  have fallen away—
                  like a mustard seed
                  from the tip of an awl:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He would say
                  what’s
                  non-grating,
                  instructive,
                  true—
                  abusing no one:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Here in the world
                  he takes nothing not-given
                  —long, short,
                  large, small,
                  attractive, not:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  His longing for this
                  & for the next world
                  can’t be found;
                  free from longing, unshackled:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  His attachments,
                  his homes,
                  can’t be found.
                  He, through knowing,8
                  is unperplexed,
                  has reached a footing
                  in          the deathless9:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He has gone
                  beyond attachment here
                  for both merit & evil—
                  sorrowless, dustless, & pure:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Spotless, pure like the moon
                  —limpid & calm—
                  his delights, his becomings,
                  totally gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He has made his way past
                  this hard-going path:
                  delusion, wandering-on.
                  He’s crossed over,
                  has gone beyond,
                  is free from want,
                  from perplexity,
                  absorbed in jhāna,
                  through no-clinging
                  unbound:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Whoever, abandoning sensual passions here,
                  would go forth from home—
                  his sensual passions, becomings,
                  totally gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Whoever, abandoning craving here,
                  would go forth from home—
                  his cravings, becomings,
                  totally gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having left behind
                  the human bond,
                  having made his way past
                  the divine,
                  from all bonds unshackled:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having left behind
                  delight & displeasure,
                  cooled, with no acquisitions—
                  a hero who has conquered
                  all the world,
                  every world:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He knows in every way
                  beings’ passing away,
                  and their re-
                  arising;
                  unattached, awakened,
                  well-gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He whose course they don’t know
                  —devas, gandhabbas, & human beings10—
                  his effluents ended, an arahant:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He who has nothing
                  —in front, behind, in between—
                  the one with nothing
                  who clings to no thing:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  A splendid bull, conqueror,
                  hero, great seer—
                  free from want,
                  awakened, washed:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He knows          his former lives.
                  He sees          heavens & states of woe,
                  has attained          the ending of birth11:
                
              
              
                
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                
              
              
                For this is a convention in the world:
                the name & clan determined,
                come into being from common consent,
                here & there determined.
                Taking a position unknowingly
                for a long time obsessively,
                those who don’t know
                say that one is a brahman by birth.
                Not by birth is one a brahman,
                not by birth a non-brahman.
                By action is one a brahman.
                By action one is a non-brahman.
                By action is one a farmer.
                By action one is a craftsman.
                By action is one a merchant.
                By action one is a servant.
                By action is one a thief.
                By action one is a soldier.
                By action is one a sacrificer.
                By action one is a king.
                The wise see action in this way
                as it has come to be,
                seeing          dependent co-arising,
                cognizant          of action’s results.
                Through action the world rolls on.
                People roll on through action.
                In action are beings held bound together,
                as in a linchpin,
                a chariot traveling along.
              
              
                Through austerity, the holy life,
                through restraint & self-control:
                That’s how one is a brahman.
                That’s a brahman
                unexcelled.
              
              
                Consummate in the three knowledges,12
                further-becoming ended, at peace:
                Know, Vāseṭṭha: That’s Brahmā, that’s Sakka,13
                for those who directly know.”
              
            
            When this was said, the young brahmans Vāseṭṭha & Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. We go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”
            vv. 594–656",(This sutta is identical with MN 98.),"s
              1. In the Brahmanical tradition, this means the three Vedas. Later in this poem, the Buddha will give “three knowledges” a Buddhist definition.
              2. In this context, Vāseṭṭha is referring to action in this lifetime, rather than action in previous lifetimes.
              3. In this and the following verses, the Buddha is playing with three meanings of the word jāti: birth, species, and nature. This point becomes clear when he later contrasts these natural distinctions in the animal world with the conventional distinctions in the human world.
              4. This verse begins a section where the verses are identical with Dhp 396–423, except that the last verse in the series is missing a line present in Dhp 423: “He is a sage who has mastered full-knowing, his mastery totally mastered.”
              This section redefines “brahman” to mean an arahant (although see note 9, below).
              As for “bho-sayer”: Brahmans, when surprised or amazed, tended to use the word bho, or master, as an exclamation. “If he has anything” (reading sa ce with the Burmese and Sri Lankan editions) = if he/she lays claim to anything as his/her own.
              5. The three commentaries explaining this verse—SnA, MA, and DhpA—treat these symbols in slightly different ways. They all agree that the strap = hatred and the thong = craving. As for the remaining symbols, MA simply states that cord = views, bridle = view-obsession, and bar = ignorance.
              SnA and DhpA, however, try to make more of the image by exploring the interconnections of the chariot parts. In their explanation, cord = 62 wrong views (listed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, DN 1) and bridle = obsessions (sensuality, becoming, anger, conceit, views, uncertainty, ignorance (AN 7:11-12)). They note the connection between the 62 wrong views and the obsessions (one of which is views), which is apparently similar to the way the cord and bridle are connected. They go on to note that when one has cut all these things, the bar, which equals ignorance, has been lifted. The fact that the cutting of these chariot parts automatically accomplishes the lifting of the bar is apparently symbolic of the fact that ignorance is one of the obsessions. 
              6. “With no overbearing pride”: reading anussadaṁ with the Thai, Burmese, and Sri Lankan editions. “Last-body”: Because an arahant will not be reborn, this present body is his/her last.
              7. “For himself, on his own, his own ending of stress”: three different ways that the one word attano functions in this verse.
              8. According to SnA, “attachments/homes (ālaya)” = cravings. “Knowing”: the knowledge of full Awakening (aññā).
              9. “A footing in the deathless”: The image here derives from a standard analogy comparing the practice to the act of crossing a river. According to AN 7:15, the point where the meditator gains footing on the river bottom, but before getting up on the bank, corresponds to the third stage of awakening, the attainment of non-return. To reach the fourth stage, becoming an arahant, is to go beyond the river and stand on firm ground. Either this verse is using the image differently, equating the gaining of a footing with arahantship, or else it is the only verse in this set to apply the term “brahman” to a non-returner.
              10. On the fact that even devas and brahmās cannot know the course of the arahant, see MN 49, SN 23:2, AN 11:10, and Dhp 92–93.
              11. The forms of mastery listed in this verse correspond to the three knowledges that comprised the Buddha’s Awakening: knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of how beings pass away and are reborn in the various levels of being, and knowledge of the ending of the effluents that maintain the process of birth (see MN 4). It’s in this verse that the Buddha redefines the three knowledges claimed by Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja, showing that they don’t qualify as masters of the three knowledges that constitute the knowledge of a genuine brahman in his eyes.
              12. Here, of course, the Buddha is referring to the three knowledges as defined by him, not as earlier defined by Vāseṭṭha.
              13. Sakka is the chief of the devas of the heaven of the Thirty-three.",No Additional
Sn 3:10  Kokālika,Sn 3:10,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_10.html,"Sn 3:10  Kokālika  —  A follower of Devadatta slanders Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Moggallāna and, after suffering a painful disease, falls into hell. The sutta then gives a graphic description of the sufferings awaiting him there.","KN/Sn/3:10
          
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the monk Kokālika1 went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, Sāriputta & Moggallāna have evil desires. They have fallen under the sway of evil desires.”
            When this was said, the Blessed One said to him, “Don’t say that, Kokālika. Don’t say that, Kolālika. Make your mind confident in Sāriputta & Moggallāna. They are admirable people.”
            A second time… A third time, the monk Kokālika said to the Blessed One, “Even though the lord Blessed One2 inspires conviction and faith in me, Sāriputta & Moggallāna have evil desires. They have fallen under the sway of evil desires.”
            A third time, the Blessed One said to him, “Don’t say that, Kokālika. Don’t say that, Kolālika. Make your mind confident in Sāriputta & Moggallāna. They are admirable people.”
            Then the monk Kokālika, getting up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, keeping him to his right, and departed.
            Then not long after he had departed, Kokālika’s whole body became covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. From the size of mustard seeds, they became the size of green gram. From the size of green gram, they became the size of black beans. From the size of black beans, they became the size of jujube pits. From the size of jujube pits, they became the size of jujube fruits. From the size of jujube fruits, they became the size of myrobalans. From the size of myrobalans, they became the size of unripe vilva fruits. From the size of unripe vilva fruits, they became the size of small jackfruits. When they were the size of small jackfruits, they burst. Blood and pus flowed out. Then the monk Kokālika died of that disease and, having died, he reappeared in the Paduma hell for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.
            Then Brahmā Sahampati,3 in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, the monk Kokālika has died and, having died, has reappeared in the Paduma hell for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.” That is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said that, having bowed down, he circumambulated the Blessed One, keeping him to his right, and disappeared right there.
            Then when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the monks, “Monks, last night Brahmā Sahampati, in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, came to me. On arrival, having bowed down to me, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to me, ‘Lord, the monk Kokālika has died and, having died, has reappeared in the Paduma hell for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.’ That is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said that, having bowed down, he circumambulated me, keeping me to his right, and disappeared right there.”
            When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, “Lord, how long is the measure of the lifespan in the Paduma hell?”
            “Long, monk, is the measure of the lifespan in the Paduma hell. It’s not easy to calculate ‘this many years’ or ‘this many hundreds of years’ or ‘this many thousands of years’ or ‘this many hundreds of thousands of years.’”
            “But, lord, can a simile be made?”
            “It can, monk,” said the Blessed One. “Suppose that there were a twenty-measure Kosalan cartload of sesame seeds. From that, a man would remove a sesame seed every hundred years.4 That twenty-measure Kosalan cartload of sesame seeds would come to an end in this manner more quickly than a single Abbuda [Swelling] hell. Like twenty Abbuda hells is one Nirabbuda [Free from Swelling] hell. Like twenty Nirabbuda hells is one Ababa [Alas!] hell. Like twenty Ababa hells is one Ahaha hell. Like twenty Ahaha hells is one Aṭaṭa hell. Like twenty Aṭaṭa hells is one Kumuda [White Water Lily] hell. Like twenty Kumuda hells is one Sogandhika [Fragrant White Water Lily] hell. Like twenty Sogandhika hells is one Uppalaka [Blue Lotus] hell. Like twenty Uppalaka hells is one Puṇḍarīka [White Lotus] hell. Like twenty Puṇḍarīka hells is one Paduma [Red Lotus] hell.5
            “The monk Kokālika has reappeared in the Paduma hell, for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Surely, when a person is born,
              an axe is born in his mouth,
              with which he cuts himself—
              the fool saying a bad statement.
              Whoever praises one deserving censure
              or censures one deserving praise,
              accumulates wickedness6 with his mouth,
              and in that wickedness
              finds no ease.
              Next to nothing is the bad throw
              when one loses money at dice.
              But great is the bad throw
              when one gets angered
              at those well-gone.
              For one hundred thousand Nirabbudas
              and thirty-six and five Abbudas,
              one who maligns noble ones,
              directing his words & heart toward evil,
              goes to hell.7
              
                He goes to hell,
                the one who asserts
                what didn’t take place,
                as does the one
                who, having done,
                says, ‘I didn’t.’
                Both—low-acting people—
                there become equal:
                after death, in the place beyond.8
              
              
                Whoever harasses
                an innocent man,
                a man pure, without blemish:
                The evil comes right back to the fool
                like fine dust
                thrown against the wind.9
              
              
                One devoted to the strings of greed
                slanders others with his words:
                faithless, stingy, miserly, mean,
                devoted to divisive tales.
              
              
                You with your hard road of a mouth,
                untrue, ignoble,
                destroyer          of progress,
                evil, doer          of wrong,
                lowest of men, wicked, degenerate:
                Don’t speak a lot here.
                You are headed to hell.
                You scatter dust
                to your harm.
                You, an offender,
                malign the good,
                and, having engaged
                in many sorts of bad conduct
                are going for a long time
                to the pit.
                For no one’s action is annihilated.
                Surely its owner gets it back.
                An offender, the fool,
                sees suffering for himself
                in the next world.
              
              
                He goes to the place set with iron spikes,
                the sharp-bladed iron stake,
                where the food, as is fitting,
                resembles a ball of heated iron.
                When they [the hell-wardens]
                speak, they don’t speak lovingly.
                They [the hell beings] can’t run away.
                They’re not going to shelter.
                They lie on ashes strewn about.
                They enter a blazing mass of fire.
                Tying them up with nets,
                they [the hell-wardens] strike them
                with hammers made of iron.
                Truly, they go to a blind darkness
                that spreads out like a fog.
                Then they enter a copper pot,
                a blazing mass of fire,
                in which they cook for a long, long time,
                bobbing up & down in a mass of fire.
                There the offender then cooks
                in a mixture of blood & pus.
                In whatever direction he leans to rest
                he festers at the touch.
                There the offender then cooks
                in an ooze where worms live,
                and there is no shore to which he can go,
                for the cooking pots all          around
                are all          the same.
                Then they enter
                the sharp sword-leaf forest
                where their limbs are cut off.
                Seizing them by the tongue with a hook,
                they [the hell-wardens] strike them,
                dragging them back & forth.
                Then they come to the Vettaraṇin,10
                hard to cross,
                with sharp blades, razor blades,
                and there they fall in,
                the fools,
                evil-doers having done
                evil deeds.
                There, while they wail,
                voracious black & spotted dogs,
                jackals, & flocks of ravens chew on them.
                Vultures & crows pick at them.
              
              
                How hard, indeed, is this way of life there
                that offending people come to see.11
                So, for the remainder of life here,
                a person, heedful, should do his duty.
              
              
                Those loads of sesame seeds
                compared to the Paduma hell
                have been calculated by those who know
                as five times ten thousand crores,12
                plus twelve times one hundred more.
              
              
                The length of the hells of suffering
                described here
                is how long [the hell-beings]
                will have to dwell there.
                So when in the company of those
                who are pure, admirable, excellent,
                one should constantly guard
                one’s words & heart.

              1. Kokālika is a bhikkhu, or Buddhist monk. Normally, the texts refer to Buddhist monks as Ven. So-and-so, but in this case, the following story will show why posterity did not accord this honor to Kokālika. According to SnA, this Kokālika was not the same Kokālika who was one of Devadatta’s followers. If that is so, it’s remarkable that both Kokālikas expressed mistrust of Ven. Sāriputta and Moggallāna in exactly the same words (see Cv VII.4.2). An alternative possibility is that the two Kokālikas were actually the same person, and that he participated in Devadatta’s schism during the “not long” period mentioned in this sutta separating his denunciation of Sāriputta and Moggallāna from the onset of his resulting disease.
              2. This is an exaggerated form of address. See Ud 8:7, note 1.
              3. See SN 6:1.
              4. Reading vassa-satassa vassa-satassa with the Burmese edition. The Sri Lankan version reads, “every hundred years, every thousand years.” The Thai edition reads, “every hundred years, every thousand years, every hundred thousand years.” 
              5. Perhaps it goes without saying that the names of some of worst hells are ironic. SnA asserts that these are not separate hells, but simply different periods of time in the single Avīci hell, but it gives no explanation or justification for its assertion.
              6. The word for wickedness, kali, is the same as the word for a bad throw at dice, which becomes the image in the following verse.
              7. The version of this sutta at SN 6:10 ends here.
              8. This verse = Dhp 306 and is also found in Iti 48.
              9. This verse = Dhp 125.
              10. Vettaraṇin: Literally, “having a battle of twigs/canes.” SnA identifies this as the river of lye-water mentioned in MN 130, which contains a similarly graphic description of hell.
              11. Reading passati with the Thai and Sri Lankan editions. The Burmese edition has phusati, “touch.”

              Asita the seer, in his mid-day meditation,
              saw the Group of Thirty—
              Sakka1 the king, and devas dressed in pure white
              exultant, ecstatic—
              holding up banners, cheering wildly,
              & on seeing the devas so joyful & happy,
              having paid his respects, he said:
              
                “Why is the deva community
                so wildly elated?
                Why are they holding up banners
                & waving them around?
                Even after the war with the Asuras
                —when victory was the devas’,
                the Asuras defeated—
                even then there was nothing hair-raising like this.
                Seeing what marvel
                are the devas so joyful?
                They whistle,
                they sing,
                play music,
                clap their hands,
                dance.
                So I ask you, who live on Mount Meru’s summit.
                Please dispel my doubt quickly, dear sirs.”
              
              
                “The Bodhisatta, the foremost jewel,
                unequaled,
                has been born for welfare & happiness
                in the human world,
                in a town in the Sakyan countryside,
                Lumbini.
                That’s why we’re contented, so wildly elated.
                He, the highest of all beings,
                the ultimate person,
                a bull among men, highest of all people,
                will set turning the Wheel [of Dhamma]
                in the forest named after the seers,
                like a strong, roaring lion,
                the conqueror of beasts.”
              
              
                Hearing these words,
                Asita quickly descended [from heaven]
                and went to Suddhodana’s dwelling.
                There, taking a seat, he said to the Sakyans:
                “Where is the prince?
                I, too, want to see him.”
                The Sakyans then showed
                to the seer named Asita
                their son, the prince,
                like gold aglow,
                burnished by a most skillful smith
                in the mouth of the furnace,
                blazing with glory, flawless in color.
                On seeing the prince blazing like flame,
                pure like the bull of the stars
                going across the sky
                —the burning sun,
                released from the clouds of autumn—
                he was exultant, filled with abundant rapture.
                The devas held in the sky
                a many-spoked sunshade
                of a thousand circles.
                Gold-handled whisks
                waved up & down,
                but those holding the whisks & the sunshade
                couldn’t be seen.
              
              
                The coiled-haired seer
                named Dark Splendor,
                seeing the boy, like an ornament of gold
                on the red woolen blanket,
                a white sunshade held over his head,
                received him, joyful in mind & pleased.
                And on receiving the bull of the Sakyans,
                longingly, the master of mantras & signs
                exclaimed with a confident mind:
                “This one is unsurpassed,
                the highest of the biped race.”
              
              
                Then, foreseeing his own imminent departure,
                he, dejected, shed tears.
                On seeing him weeping,
                the Sakyans asked:
                “But surely there will be
                no danger for the prince?”
                On seeing the Sakyans’ concern
                he replied, “I foresee for the prince
                no harm.
                Nor will there be any danger for him.
                This one’s not insignificant: Be assured.
                This prince will touch
                the ultimate self-awakening.
                He, seeing the utmost purity,
                will set rolling the Wheel of Dhamma
                through sympathy for the welfare of many.
                His holy life will spread far & wide.
              
              
                But as for me,
                my life here has no long remainder.
                My death will take place before then.
                I won’t get to hear
                the Dhamma of this one with the peerless role.
                That’s why I’m stricken,
                afflicted, & pained.”
              
              
                He, having brought the Sakyans
                abundant rapture,
                the follower of the holy life
                left the inner chamber and,
                out of sympathy for his nephew,
                urged him on toward the Dhamma
                of the one with the peerless role:
                “When you hear from another the word,
                ‘Awakened One,’
                or ‘Attaining self-awakening,
                he lays open the path of the Dhamma,’
                go there and, asking him yourself,
                follow the holy life
                under that Blessed One.”
              
              
                Instructed by the one
                whose mind was set on his benefit,
                Such,
                seeing in the future the utmost purity,
                Nālaka, who had laid up a store of merit,
                awaited the Victor expectantly,
                guarding his senses.
                On hearing word of the Victor’s
                turning of the foremost wheel,
                he went, he saw
                the bull among seers. Confident,
                he asked the foremost sage
                about the utmost sagacity,
                now that Asita’s forecast
                had come to pass.
              
              
                Nālaka:
                “Now that I know
                Asita’s words to be true,
                I ask you, Gotama,
                you who have gone
                to the beyond of all dhammas.
                I’m intent on the homeless life;
                I long for the almsround.
                Tell me sage, when asked,
                the highest state of sagacity.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “I’ll teach you
                a sagacity          hard to do,
                hard to master.
                Come now, I’ll tell you.
                Be steadfast. Be firm.
                Practice even-mindedness,
                for in a village
                there’s praise & abuse.
                Ward off any flaw in the heart.
                Go about calmed & not haughty.
                High & low things will come up
                like fire-flames in a forest.
                Women seduce a sage.
                May they not seduce you.2
                Abstaining from sexual intercourse,
                abandoning various sensual pleasures,
                be unopposed, unattached,
                to beings moving & still.
                ‘As I am, so are these.
                As are these, so am I.’
                Drawing the parallel to
                yourself,
                neither kill nor get others to kill.
                Abandoning the wants & greed
                where people run-of-the-mill are stuck,
                practice with vision,
                cross over this hell.
              
              
                Stomach not full,
                moderate in food,
                modest,
                not being greedy,
                always not hungering for wants:
                One without hunger
                is one who’s unbound.
              
              
                Having gone on his almsround, the sage
                should then go to the forest,
                approaching the root of a tree,
                taking a seat.
                The enlightened one, intent on jhāna,
                should find delight in the forest,
                should practice jhāna at the foot of a tree,
                attaining his own satisfaction.
                Then, at the end of the night,
                he should go to the village,
                not delighting in an invitation
                or gift from the village.
                Having gone to the village,
                the sage should not go
                forcing his way among families.
                Cutting off chatter,
                he shouldn’t utter a scheming word.
                ‘I got something,
                that’s fine.
                I got nothing,
                that, too, is good.’
                Being such with regard to both,
                he returns to the very same tree.
                Wandering with his bowl in hand
                —not dumb,
                but seemingly dumb—
                he shouldn’t despise a piddling gift
                nor disparage the giver.
                High & low are the practices
                proclaimed by the contemplative.
                They don’t go twice to the further shore.
                This [unbinding] isn’t sensed only once.3
                In one who has no attachment—
                the monk who has cut the stream,4
                abandoning what is
                & isn’t a duty—
                no fever is found.
              
              
                I’ll teach you
                sagacity:Be like a razor’s edge.
                Pressing tongue against palate,
                restrain your stomach.
                Neither be lazy in mind,
                nor have many thoughts.
                Be free of raw stench,5
                independent,
                having the holy life as your aim.
                Train in     solitude
                & the contemplative’s task,
                Solitude
                is called
                sagacity.
                Alone, you truly delight
                & shine in the ten directions.
              
              
                On hearing the fame of the enlightened
                —those who practice jhāna,
                relinquishing sensuality—
                my disciple should foster
                all the more
                shame & conviction.
              
              
                Know from the rivers
                in clefts & in crevices:
                Those in small channels flow
                noisily,
                the great
                flow silent.
              
              
                Whatever’s deficient
                makes noise.
                Whatever is full
                is quiet.
                The fool is like a half-empty pot;
                one who is wise, a full lake.6
              
              
                A contemplative who speaks a great deal
                endowed with meaning:
                Knowing, he teaches the Dhamma;
                knowing, he speaks a great deal.
                But he who,
                knowing, is restrained,
                knowing, doesn’t speak a great deal:
                He is a sage
                worthy of sagehood.
                He is a sage,
                his sagehood attained.”

              3. According to SnA, the high and low practices taught by the Buddha are, respectively, the practice-mode of pleasant practice and quick intuition, and the practice-mode of painful practice and slow intuition (see AN 4:162). These modes of practice don’t go twice to the further shore in the sense that each of the four paths—to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship—abandons whatever defilements it is capable of abandoning once and for all. There is no need to repeat that particular path. Unbinding is not attained only once in the sense that it is touched as the result of each of the four paths.
              4. SnA: the stream of defilements. However, the stream here could also be the stream of becoming mentioned in Sn 3:12.

Sn 3:12  The Contemplation of Dualities,Sn 3:12,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_12.html,Sn 3:12  The Contemplation of Dualities  —  Not all dualities are misleading. This sutta teaches ways to contemplate the duality of the origination and cessation of stress and suffering so as to reach awakening.,"KN/Sn/3:12
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra’s mother. Now on that occasion—the uposatha day of the fifteenth, a perfect full-moon night—the Blessed One was sitting in the open air surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Surveying the silent Saṅgha of monks, he addressed them: “Monks, if there are any who ask, ‘Your listening to teachings that are skillful, noble, leading onward, going to self-awakening is a prerequisite for what?’ they should be told, ‘For the sake of knowing qualities of dualities as they actually are.’ Which duality are you speaking about? ‘This is stress. This is the origination of stress’: This is one contemplation. ‘This is the cessation of stress. This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Those who don’t discern stress,
              what brings stress into play,
              & where it totally stops,
              without trace;
              who don’t know the path,
              the way to the stilling of stress:
              lowly
              in their awareness-release
              & discernment-release,
              incapable
              of making an end,
              they’re headed
              to birth & aging.
              
                But those who discern stress,
                what brings stress into play,
                & where it totally stops,
                without trace;
                who discern the path,
                the way to the stilling of stress:
                consummate
                in their awareness-release
                & discernment-release,
                capable
                of making an end,
                they aren’t headed
                to birth & aging.1
              
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from acquisition2 as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very acquisition, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “From acquisition as cause
              the many forms of stress
              come into being in the world.
              Whoever, unknowing,
              makes acquisitions
              —the dullard—
              comes to stress
              again & again.
              
                Therefore, discerning,
                you shouldn’t create acquisitions
                as you stay focused on
                the birth & origin of stress.”
              
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from ignorance as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very ignorance, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Those who journey the wandering-on
              through birth & death, again & again,
              in this state here
              or anywhere else,
              that destination is simply through ignorance.
              This ignorance is a great delusion
              whereby they have wandered-on
              a long, long time.
              While beings immersed in clear knowing
              don’t go to further becoming.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very fabrication, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Any stress that comes into play
              is all from fabrication
              as a requisite
              condition.
              With the cessation of fabrication,
              there is no stress
              coming into play.
              Knowing this drawback—
              that stress comes from fabrication
              as a requisite
              condition—
              with the tranquilizing of all fabrication,
              with the stopping of perception:
              That’s how there is
              the ending of stress.
              Knowing this as it actually is,
              an attainer-of-knowledge
              sees rightly.
              Seeing rightly,
              the wise—
              conquering the fetter of Māra—
              go to no further becoming.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from consciousness as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very consciousness, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:

              condition.
              With the cessation of consciousness,
              there is no stress
              coming into play.
              Knowing this drawback—
              that stress comes from consciousness
              as a requisite
              condition—
              with the stilling of consciousness, the monk
              free from hunger
              is totally unbound.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from contact as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very contact, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “For those overcome by contact,
              flowing along in the stream of becoming,
              following a miserable path,
              the ending of fetters
              is far away.
              While those who comprehend contact,
              delighting in stilling through discernment,
              they, by breaking through contact,
              free from hunger,
              are totally unbound.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from feeling as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very feeling, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Knowing that
              whatever is felt—
              pleasure, pain,
              neither pleasure nor pain,
              within or without—
              is stressful;
              seeing
              its deceptive nature,
              its dissolving,
              its passing away
              at each contact,
              each
              contact,
              he knows it right there:
              With just the ending of feeling,
              there is no stress
              coming into play.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from craving as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very craving, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “With craving his companion, a man
              wanders on a long, long time.
              Neither in this state here
              nor anywhere else
              does he go beyond
              the wandering-          on.
              Knowing this drawback—
              that craving brings stress into play—
              free     from craving,
              devoid     of clinging,
              mindful,     the monk
              lives the mendicant life.”3
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from clinging as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very clinging, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation.

            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “From clinging as a requisite condition
              comes becoming.
              One who has come into being
              goes
              to stress.
              There is death
              for one who is born.
              This is the coming into play
              of stress.
              Thus, with the ending of clinging, the wise
              seeing rightly,
              directly knowing
              the ending of birth,
              go to no further becoming.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from arousal4 as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very arousal, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation.

              there is no stress
              coming into play.
              Knowing this drawback—
              that stress comes from arousal
              as a requisite

              with the relinquishing
              of all arousal,

              his craving for becoming     crushed,
              his mind at peace,
              his wandering-on in birth totally ended:

            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Any stress that comes into play
              is all from what is perturbed
              as a requisite
              condition.
              With the cessation of what is perturbed,
              there is no stress
              coming into play.
              Knowing this drawback—
              that stress comes from what is perturbed
              as a requisite
              condition—
              the monk thus renouncing perturbance,
              putting a stop to fabrications,
              free from perturbance, free
              from clinging,
              mindful he lives
              the mendicant life.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘For one who is dependent, there is wavering’: This is one contemplation. ‘One who is independent doesn’t waver’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “One independent
              doesn’t
              waver.
              One dependent,
              clinging
              to this state here
              or anywhere else,
              doesn’t go beyond
              the wandering-on.
              Knowing this drawback—
              the great danger in
              dependencies—
              in-
              dependent,
              free from clinging,
              mindful the monk
              lives the mendicant life.8
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Formless phenomena are more peaceful than forms’: This is one contemplation. ‘Cessation is more peaceful than formless phenomena’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              Those beings headed to forms,
              and those standing in the formless,
              with no knowledge of cessation,
              return to further becoming.
              
                But, comprehending form,
                not taking a stance in formless things,
                those released in cessation
                are people who’ve left death          behind.9
              
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever is considered as “This is true” by the world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, by this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, is rightly seen as it has come to be with right discernment by the noble ones as “This is false”’: This is one contemplation. ‘Whatever is considered as “This is false” by the world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, by this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, is rightly seen as it has come to be with right discernment by the noble ones as “This is true”’: This is a second contemplation.

            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “See the world, together with its devas,
              supposing not-self to be self.
              Entrenched in name-&-form,
              they suppose that ‘This is true.’
              In whatever terms they suppose it
              it turns into something other than that,10
              and that’s what’s false about it:
              Changing,
              it’s deceptive by nature.
              Undeceptive by nature
              is unbinding11:
              That the noble ones know
              as true.
              They, through breaking through
              to the truth,
              hunger-free,
              are totally unbound.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever is considered as “This is bliss” by the world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, by this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, is rightly seen as it has come to be with right discernment by the noble ones as “This is stressful”’: This is one contemplation. ‘Whatever is considered as “This is stressful” by the world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, by this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, is rightly seen as it has come to be with right discernment by the noble ones as “This is bliss”’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “All sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
              tactile sensations, & ideas
              that are     welcome,
              appealing,

              as long as they’re said
              to exist,
              are supposed by the world
              together with its devas
              to be bliss.
              But when they cease,
              that’s supposed by them
              to be stress.
              The stopping of self-identity
              is viewed by the noble ones
              as bliss.
              This, when seen,
              runs counter
              to the whole world.
              
                What others say               is blissful,
                the noble ones say     is stress.
                What others say          is stressful,
                the noble know     as bliss.
                See the Dhamma, hard to understand!
                Here those who don’t know
                are confused.
                For those who are veiled,
                it’s     darkness,
                blindness
                for those who don’t see.
                But for the good it is blatant,
                like light for those who see.
              
              
                Though in its very presence,
                they don’t understand it—
                dumb animals, unadept in the Dhamma.
                It’s not easy
                for those overcome
                by passion for becoming,
                flowing along
                in the stream of becoming,
                falling under Māra’s sway,12
                to wake up
                to this Dhamma.
              
              
                Who, apart from the noble,
                is worthy to wake up
                to this state?—
                the state that,
                through rightly knowing it,
                they totally unbind,
                effluent-free.”
              
            
            That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One’s words. And while this explanation was being given, the minds of 60 monks, through lack of clinging, were released from effluents.

              2. The term ‘acquisition’ (upadhi), in its everyday sense, denotes the possessions, baggage, and other paraphernalia that a nomadic family might carry around with it in its wanderings. On the psychological level, it denotes anything for which one might have a sense of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ and which, consequently, one would carry around as a kind of mental baggage.

              If one, longing for sensual pleasure,
              achieves it, yes,
              he’s enraptured at heart.
              The mortal gets what he wants.
              But if for that person
              —longing, desiring—
              the pleasures diminish,
              he’s afflicted,
              as if shot with an arrow.
              
                Whoever avoids sensual desires
                —as he would, with his foot,
                the head of a snake—
                goes beyond, mindful,

States of not-becoming are oblivious states of becoming that people can get themselves into through a desire for annihilation, either after death or as a goal of their religious striving (see Iti 49 and MN 49). As with all states of becoming, these states are impermanent and stressful. 
              6. According to Nd I, “both sides” here has several possible meanings: sensory contact and the origination of sensory contact; past and future; name and form; internal and external sense media; self-identity and the origination of self-identity. It also might mean states of becoming and not-becoming, mentioned in the previous verse and below, in Sn 4:5.
              7. Nd I: Comprehending sensory contact has three aspects: being able to identity and distinguish types of sensory contact; contemplating the true nature of sensory contact (e.g., inconstant, stressful, and not-self); and abandoning attachment to sensory contact. The same three aspects would apply to comprehending perception, as mentioned in the following verse.

                He’d dispute in line
                with the way that he knows.
              
              
                Whoever boasts to others, unasked,
                of his practices, habits,
                is, say the skilled,
                ignoble by nature—
                he who speaks of himself
                of his own accord.
              
              
                But a monk at peace,
                fully unbound in himself,
                not boasting of his habits
                —”That’s how I am”—
                he, say the skilled,
                is noble by nature—
                he with no vanity
                anywhere in the world.
              
              
                One whose doctrines aren’t clean—
                fabricated, formed, given preference
                when he sees it to his own advantage—
                relies on a peace
                dependent
                on the provoked.1
                Because entrenchments2 in views
                aren’t easily overcome
                when considering what’s grasped
                among doctrines,
                that’s why
                a person embraces or rejects a doctrine—
                in light of these very
                entrenchments.
              
              
                Now, one who is cleansed3
                has no theorized view
                about states of becoming
                or not-
                anywhere in the world.
                Having abandoned conceit4 & illusion,
                by what means would he go?5
                He isn’t involved,
                for one who’s involved
                enters into disputes
                over doctrines.
                But how—in connection with what6—
                would you argue
                with one uninvolved?
                He has nothing
                embraced or rejected,7
                has sloughed off every view
                right here—every one.

              1. Kuppa-paṭicca. Underlying many of the Canon’s explanations of physical and mental phenomena is the theory of dhātu—element or property—in which phenomena are said to happen because an underlying dhātu, which normally exists in a potential form, is provoked into being actualized. Fires, for instance, come from the provocation of the fire dhātu that is everywhere present. When the provocation ends, the dhātu returns to its potential state, and the phenomenon ends. Thus any phenomenon that depends on provocation is by nature inconstant and unreliable. This is one of the reasons why the experience of full release is said to be unprovoked, because it does not depend on the provocation of a dhātu, and so is free from the potential for change. For more on this point, see MN 29, note 3.
              2. Entrenchments: a rendering of the Pali term, nivesana, which can also be translated as dwelling (see Sn 1:12, note 5), abode, situation, home, or establishment.
              Nd II illustrates the meaning of “entrenchments in views” with these ten views (found, in various forms, in DN 9, MN 72, and AN 10:93): “The cosmos is eternal. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.” “The cosmos is not eternal…” “The cosmos is finite…” ”The cosmos is infinite…” ”The soul & the body are the same…” ”The soul is one thing & the body another…” ”After death a Tathāgata exists…” ”After death a Tathāgata does not exist…” ”After death a Tathāgata both does & does not exist…” ”After death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not exist. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.”
              3. Nd I: Cleansed through discernment.","the explanation of “washed” in Sn 3:6.
              4. Nd I explains a variety of ways of understanding the word “conceit,” the most comprehensive being a list of nine kinds of conceit: viewing people better than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people on a par with oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people worse than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself. In other words, the truth of the view is not the issue here; the issue is the tendency to compare oneself with others. See AN 6:49. See also AN 4:159.
              5. Nd I: “By what means would he go” to any destination in any state of becoming.
              6. “In connection with what”: a rendering of the instrumental case that attempts to cover several of its meanings, in particular “by what means” and “in terms of what.” For a discussion of the use of the instrumental case in the Aṭṭhaka Vagga, see Sn 4:9, note 4.
              7. This reading follows the Thai, Sri Lankan, and PTS editions: attaṁ nirattaṁ. The Burmese edition reads, attā nirattā: “He has no self, nor what’s opposed to self.” As GD points out in its notes to the translation of this verse, the first reading is probably the correct one, as it relates to the poem’s earlier reference to a person embracing or rejecting a doctrine. The fact that an awakened person is free from both embracing and rejecting is a recurring theme in this vagga and the next; the confusion at present in the various recensions as to whether similar lines should read attaṁ/nirattaṁ or attā/nirattā is a recurring textual theme as well. (See Sn 4:4, note 4; Sn 4:10, note 7; Sn 4:14, note 2.) 
              For a discussion of the conditions under which the Buddha would enter into a debate, see Skill in Questions, chapter 5.

              “I see the pure, the supreme,

              Understanding thus,
              having known the “supreme,”
              & remaining focused
              on purity,

              then a person with acquisitions
              is purified
              in connection with something else,2
              for his view betrays that
              in the way he asserts it.
              
                No brahman3
                says purity
                comes in connection

                merit or evil,
                not creating
                anything here,
                he’s let go

                Abandoning          what’s first,
                they depend on     what’s next.5
                Following perturbation,6
                they don’t cross over the bond.
                They embrace & reject
                —like a monkey releasing a branch
                to seize at another7—
                a person undertaking practices on his own,
                goes high & low,
                latched onto perception.
                But having clearly known
                through vedas,8 having encountered
                the Dhamma,
                one deeply discerning
                doesn’t go

                should he

              1. An ancient Indian belief, dating back to the Vedas, was that the sight of certain things or beings was believed to purify. Thus “in connection with what’s seen” here means both that purity is brought about by means of seeing such a sight, and that one’s purity is measured in terms of having such a sight. This belief survives today in the practice of darshan. See DN 16, note 44.
              2. In other words, if purity were simply a matter of seeing or knowing something, a person could be pure in this sense and yet still have acquisitions (= defilements), which would not be true purity. On the use of the phrase, “in connection with,” here, see Sn 4:9, note 4.
              3. “Brahman” in the Buddhist sense, i.e., a person born in any caste who has become an arahant.
              4. Lines such as this may have been the source of the confusion in the different recensions of the Canon—and in Nd I—as to whether the poems in this vagga are concerned with letting go of views that have been embraced (atta) or of self (attā). The compound here, attañjaho, read on its own, could be read either as “he’s let go of what has been embraced” or “he’s let go of self.” However, the following image of a monkey seizing and releasing branches as it moves from tree to tree reinforces the conclusion that the first interpretation is the correct one.
              5. Nd I: Leaving one teacher and going to another; leaving one teaching and going to another. This phrase may also refer to the mind’s tendency to leave one craving to go to another.
              6. For a discussion of unperturbed states of concentration, see MN 106.
              7. “Like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another”—an interesting example of a whole phrase that functions as a lamp, i.e., modifying both the phrase before it and the phrase after it. 
              8. “Vedas”—Just as the word “brahman” is used in a Buddhist sense above, here the word veda is given a Buddhist sense. According to SnA, in this context it means the knowledge accompanying four transcendent paths: the paths to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.
              9. Nd I: The enemies here are the armies of Māra—all unskillful mental qualities. For a detailed inventory of Māra’s armies, see Sn 3:2.
              10. “By whom, with what”—two meanings of the one Pali word, kena.
              11. Nd I: “Open” means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This relates to the many references in Sn to the idea of having one’s roof opened up (see Sn 2:13, note 3). This is in contrast to the image discussed Sn 4:2, note 1.
              12. Nd I: “Territories” = the ten fetters (saṁyojana) and seven obsessions (anusaya).
              13. Nd I: “Passion” = sensuality; “dispassion” = the jhāna states that bring about dispassion for sensuality. However, this may also be a reference to the fact that dispassion is the highest dhamma, whether fabricated or unfabricated (Iti 90), and yet the arahant is described in Sn 5:6 as having transcended all phenomena. See AN 3:137, note 1 and Sn 4:6, note 2.",: MN 61; AN 5:170

              When dwelling on views
              as “supreme,”
              a person makes them
              the utmost thing in the world,
              &, from that, calls
              all others inferior
              and so he’s not gone beyond disputes.
              When he sees his own advantage
              in what’s seen, heard, sensed,
              or in habits & practices,
              seizing it there
              he sees all else, all others,
              as inferior.
              
                That, too, say the skilled,
                is a binding knot: that
                in dependence on which
                you regard another
                as inferior.
                So a monk shouldn’t be dependent
                on what’s seen, heard, or sensed,
                or on habits & practices;
                nor should he theorize a view in the world
                in connection with knowledge
                or habits & practices;
                shouldn’t take himself
                to be “equal”;
                shouldn’t think himself
                inferior or superlative.
              
              
                Abandoning what he’d embraced,
                not clinging,
                he doesn’t make himself dependent
                even in connection with knowledge;
                doesn’t follow a faction
                among those who are split;
                doesn’t fall back

                nothing is constantly possessed.1
                Seeing this separation

                Realizing this, the wise
                shouldn’t incline
                to be devoted to mine-ness.
              
              
                Just as a man doesn’t see

              Having heard your teaching,
              we’ll train in seclusion.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “In one given over
                to sexual intercourse,
                the teaching is muddled
                and he practices wrongly:
                This is ignoble
                in him.
                Whoever once went alone,
                but then resorts
                to sexual intercourse
                —like a carriage out of control—
                is called vile in the world,
                a person run-of-the-mill.
                His earlier honor & dignity:
                lost.
                Seeing this,
                he should train himself
                to abandon sexual intercourse.
              
              
                Overcome by resolves,
                he broods
                like a miserable wretch.
                Hearing the scorn of others,
                he’s chagrined.
                He makes weapons,
                attacked by the words of others.
                This, for him, is a great entanglement.
                He
                sinks
                into lies.
              
              
                They thought him wise
                when he committed himself
                to the life alone,
                but now that he’s given
                to sexual intercourse
                they declare him a dullard.
              
              
                Knowing these drawbacks, the sage
                here—before & after—
                stays firm in the life alone;
                doesn’t resort to sexual intercourse;
                would train himself
                in seclusion—
                this, for the noble,
                is highest.
                He wouldn’t, because of that,
                suppose himself
                to be better than others:
                He’s on the verge

              ‘No other doctrines are pure’
              —so they say.
              Insisting that what they depend on is good,
              they are deeply entrenched
              in idiosyncratic truths.1
              
                Seeking controversy, they plunge into an assembly,
                regarding one another as fools.
                Relying on others’ authority,
                they speak in debate.
                Desiring praise, they claim to be skilled.
              
              
                Engaged in disputes in the midst of the assembly,
                —anxious, desiring praise—
                the one defeated is
                chagrined.
                Shaken with criticism, he seeks for an opening.
              
              
                He whose doctrine is [judged as] demolished,
                defeated, by those judging the issue:
                He laments, he grieves—the inferior exponent.
                ‘He beat me,’ he mourns.
              
              
                These disputes have arisen among contemplatives.
                In them are
                elation,
                dejection.
                Seeing this, one should abstain from disputes,
                for they have no other goal
                than the gaining of praise.
              
              
                While he who is praised there
                for expounding his doctrine
                in the midst of the assembly,
                laughs on that account & grows haughty,
                attaining his heart’s desire.
              
              
                That haughtiness will be grounds for his damage,
                for he’ll speak in pride & conceit.
                Seeing this, one should abstain from debates.
                No purity is attained by them, say the skilled.
              
              
                Like a strong man nourished on royal food,
                you prowl about, roaring, searching out an opponent.
                Wherever the battle is,
                go there, strong man.
                As before, there’s none here.
              
              
                Those who dispute, taking hold of a view,
                saying, “This, and this only, is true,”
                those you can talk to.
                Here there is nothing—
                no confrontation
                at the birth of disputes.2
              
              
                Whom would you gain as opponent, Pasūra,
                among those who live above confrontation—
                not pitting view against view—
                who have nothing here grasped as supreme?
              
              
                So here you come,
                conjecturing,
                your mind thinking up
                viewpoints.
                You’re paired off with a pure one

              1. Pacceka-sacca. The word pacceka can also mean singular, personal, or individual. AN 10:20 lists the following views as idiosyncratic truths. “The cosmos is eternal,” “The cosmos is not eternal,” “The cosmos is finite,” “The cosmos is infinite,” “The soul & the body are the same,” “The soul is one thing & the body another,” “After death a Tathāgata exists,” “After death a Tathāgata does not exist,” “After death a Tathāgata both does & does not exist,” “After death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not exist.” These truths are distinct from noble truths, in that the word for “noble”—ariya—can also mean “universal.”

              —Discontent, Craving, & Passion—
              there wasn’t even the desire for sex.
              So what would I want with this,
              filled with urine & excrement?
              I wouldn’t want to touch it

                “Sage, you speak
                of not grasping
                at any theorized judgments.
                This ‘inner peace’:
                What does it mean?
                How is it,

                learning,

                of learning,
                of knowledge,

                Letting these go, without grasping,
                at peace,
                independent,
                one wouldn’t long for becoming.”

                it seems to me that this teaching’s

                dependent on view,
                you’re confused
                by the things you have grasped.
                And so you don’t glimpse

                the slightest
                notion
                [of what I am saying].

                ‘superior,’ or
                ‘inferior,’
                by that he’d dispute;
                whereas to one unaffected
                by these three,
                ‘equal,’
                ‘superior,’
                do not occur.
              
              
                Of what would the brahman say ‘true’
                or ‘false,’
                with whom would he dispute?
                With whom would he join in dispute,
                he in whom ‘equal,’ ‘unequal’ are not?

                living free from society,
                the sage
                in villages
                creates no intimacies.
                Remote from sensuality, not
                preferring,
                he wouldn’t engage with people
                in quarrelsome debate.7
              
              
                Those things
                aloof from which
                he should go about in the world:
                The Nāga
                wouldn’t take them up
                & argue for them.
              
              
                As the prickly lotus
                is unsmeared by water & mud,
                so the sage,
                an exponent of peace,
                without greed,
                is unsmeared by sensuality &

              4. Putting the first two sentences of this verse together and making sense of them is the major challenge for anyone trying to translate this poem. The reading given here is based on considerations of both grammar and context.
              a) First, grammar: The Pali of the first sentence puts the words for “view, learning, knowledge, habit, & practice” in the instrumental case. This case stands for the relationship “by means of” or “because of” but it also has an idiomatic meaning: “in terms of.” (To keep the translation neutral on this point, I have translated with the idiom, “in connection with,” which can carry both possibilities.) The second sentence puts the words for lack of view, etc., in the ablative case, which carries the meaning “because of” or “from.” 
              If we assume that the instrumental case in the first sentence is meant in the sense of “by means of,” then we are dealing—as Māgandiya asserts—with plain nonsense: The first sentence would say that a person cannot achieve purity by means of views, etc., while the second sentence would be saying that he cannot achieve purity by means of no view, etc. 
              The fact that the two sentences place the relevant terms in different grammatical cases, though, suggests that they are talking about two different kinds of relationships. If we take the instrumental in the first sentence idiomatically in the sense of “in terms of,” then the verse not only makes sense but also fits in with teachings of the rest of the Pali suttas: A person cannot be said to be pure simply because he/she holds to a particular view, body of learning, etc. Purity is not defined in those terms. The second sentence goes on to say that a person doesn’t arrive at purity from a lack of view, etc. Putting the two sentences together with the third, the message is this: One uses right views, learning, knowledge, habits, & practices as a path, a means for arriving at purity. Once one arrives, one lets go of the path, because the purity of inner peace, in its ultimate sense, is something transcending the means by which it is reached.
              b) The immediate context of this verse supports this interpretation. The Buddha’s initial statement here is an answer, not to the question of how the goal is attained, but to Māgandiya’s question of how an enlightened person would describe the goal. The Buddha responds by contradicting the general views current in his time as to how such a state would be defined, and so in this context the meaning of “in terms of” makes the most immediate sense. Then, having shown that description isn’t helpful, the Buddha goes on to discuss the most useful thing that can be said about such a state: how to get there. 
              However, in the verse immediately following this one, it’s obvious that Māgandiya has not caught this distinction and so misses the Buddha’s point.
              For further illustrations of the role of right view in taking one to a dimension beyond all views, see AN 10:93, AN 10:96, MN 22 (in particular, the simile of the raft), and MN 24. (The analogy of the relay coaches in MN 24 actually seems more tailored to the issues raised by the Buddha’s remarks in this sutta than it does to the question it addresses in that one.)","sections III/H and III/H/i in The Wings to Awakening. 
              Nd I, without explaining the grammatical word play at work in this verse, offers an interpretation in line with the one offered in this note: On the one hand, it says, one doesn’t describe purity or release in terms of view, etc. On the other, one cannot attain inner peace without using a measure of right view, learning, knowledge, habit (virtue), and practice. It defines right view in terms of mundane right view, described in MN 117; learning in terms of the voice of another (AN 2:124) and the nine traditional divisions of Dhamma in the Canon: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions (AN 7:64); knowledge in terms of knowledge of what has been done by action, knowledge in line with the four noble truths, the knowledge of the six forms of direct knowing (AN 5:28), and knowledge of the nine concentration attainments (AN 9:33); habit (virtue) in terms of restraint in the Pāṭimokkha (AN 10:17); and practice in terms of eight of the dhutaṅga practices: living in the wilderness, going for alms, wearing cast-off cloth, wearing only one triple set of robes, bypassing no donors on one’s alms round, refusing food brought afterwards, not lying down, and accepting whatever lodging one is assigned (see Thag 16:7 and SN 16:5). It is important to note that Nd I does not insist that all these practices and forms of knowledge, etc., must be completely mastered to attain inner peace. Instead, it insists that a “measure” (matta) be mastered, without defining how large that measure must be. 
              5. The lines of this verse up to this point are clearly missing in the text of the Sanskrit version found in East Turkestan. Hoernle, the scholar who first studied the text, concluded that the lines in the Pali here must have been a later interpolation, but it’s also possible that the Sanskrit was either a faulty translation or an accurate translation based on a faulty transmission of the text.
              6. “In terms of—by means of”: Two ways of interpreting the instrumental case in this sentence.
              7. A long explanation of this verse, attributed to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, is contained in SN 22:3. The main points are these:
              “The property of form, householder, is the home of consciousness. When consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of form, it is said to be living at home. The property of feeling… perception… fabrication is the home of consciousness. When consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of fabrication, it is said to be dwelling at home.
              “And how does one not live at home? Any desire, passion, delight, craving, any attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions with regard to the property of form: These the Tathāgata has abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Therefore the Tathāgata is said to be not dwelling at home.
              [Similarly with the remaining aggregates.] …
              “And how does one live free from society? The Tathāgata has abandoned bondage to the distraction of the society of form-impressions, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Therefore the Tathāgata is said to be living free from society.
              [Similarly with the society of sound-impressions, aroma-impressions, flavor-impressions, tactile-sensation-impressions, and idea-impressions.]
              “And how is one not intimate in villages? There is the case where a monk lives unentangled with householders. Not delighting together with them, not sorrowing together with them, not happy when they are happy, not pained when they are pained, he does not take on any of their arisen business affairs as his own duty. This is how one is not intimate in villages.…
              “And how is one remote from sensuality? There is the case where a certain person is free of passion for sensuality, free of desire, free of love, free of thirst, free of fever, free of craving for sensuality. This is how one is remote from sensuality.…
              “And how is one free from preferences? There is the case where a certain person does not think, ‘May form be like this in the future. May feeling.… May perception.… May fabrication.… May consciousness be like this in the future.’ This is how one is free from preferences.…
              “And how does one not engage with people in quarrelsome debate? There is the case where a certain person is not a fomenter of this kind of debate: ‘You understand this doctrine & discipline? I’m the one who understands this doctrine & discipline. How could you understand this doctrine & discipline? You’re practicing wrongly. I’m practicing rightly. What should be said first you said last. What should be said last you said first. I’m being consistent. You’re not. What you took so long to think out has been refuted. Your doctrine has been overthrown. You’re defeated. Go and try to salvage your doctrine, or extricate yourself if you can!’ This is how one does not engage with people in quarrelsome debate.”
              8. “Measured … made proud”—two meanings of the Pali word mānameti.
              9. To be fashioned by something is to define oneself around it. See MN 78, note 2; and MN 113. For discussions of the role of non-fashioning in the practice, see The Wings to Awakening, II/B and III/G, and The Paradox of Becoming, chapter 6. 
              10. “Action” here can mean either kamma in a restricted sense, as ritual action, or in its general sense, meaning that the attainer-of-knowledge has gone beyond creating seeds of kamma that will lead to further becoming (see AN 3:34). According to Nd I, “action” here denotes the three types of fabrication (abhisaṅkhāra): meritorious (ripening in pleasure), demeritorious (ripening in pain), and imperturbable (the formless attainments)—see DN 33.

              2. For discussions of how the awakened one cannot be classified even in the present, see MN 72 and SN 22:85–86.
              3. Nd I: “He sees seclusion in the midst of sensory contacts” = he sees contact as empty of self. This passage may also refer to the fact that the awakened person experiences sensory contact as if disjoined from it. On this point, see MN 140 and MN 146, quoted in The Mind Like Fire Unbound, chapter 4.

              5. Beyond conviction & dispassion—The Pali here can also mean, “A person of no conviction, he does not put away passion.” This is an example of the kind of pun occasionally used in Pali poetry for its shock value. Other examples are at Dhp 97 and the end of Sn 4:13. For examples of what is meant by being beyond conviction, see SN 12:68 and SN 48:44. For an explanation of what is meant by being beyond dispassion, see Sn 4:6, note 2. An alternate explanation is that, as Sn 5:6 indicates, the arahant is beyond all dhammas, dispassion included.
              6. The Pali word taṇhāya—by/through craving—functions here as a lamp.
              7. This reading follows the Thai and PTS editions: attaṁ vā-pi nirattaṁ vā. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions read, attā vā-pi nirattā vā: “self or what’s opposed to self.” The first reading seems preferable for two reasons: First, it follows the theme established in Sn 4:3 and Sn 4:4 (and also followed in Sn 4:15 and Sn 5:11) that the awakened person has gone beyond embracing or rejecting views. Second, the word nirattā is found nowhere else in the Canon aside from the two other verses in Sn (4:3 and 4:14) where it is offered as a possible alternative reading for niratta (released, rejected). As niratta is clearly the preferable alternative in Sn 4:3, I have adopted it here and in Sn 4:14 as well.

                “Conditioned by name-&-form
                is contact.
                In longing do graspings,
                possessions have their cause.
                When longing isn’t,
                mine-ness doesn’t exist.
                When forms have disappeared
                contacts don’t touch.”
              
              
                “For one how-arriving
                does form disappear?
                How do pleasure & pain disappear?
                Tell me this.
                My heart is set
                on knowing how
                they disappear.”
              
              
                “One not percipient of perceptions
                not percipient of aberrant perceptions,
                not unpercipient,
                nor percipient of what’s disappeared2:
                For one thus-arriving,
                form disappears3—
                for objectification-classifications4

                Please tell it.
                Do some of the wise
                say that just this much is the utmost,
                that purity of spirit5 is here?

                : He’s enlightened.”

              1. As other passages in this poem indicate (see note 6, below), the goal is not measured in terms of knowledge, but as this passage points out, knowledge is a necessary part of the path to the goal.
              2. According to Nd I, “percipient of perceptions” means having ordinary perceptions. “Percipient of aberrant perceptions” means being insane. “Unpercipient” means either having entered the cessation of perception and feeling (see AN 9:33) or the dimension of beings without perception (DN 1 and DN 15). “Percipient of what’s disappeared” (or: having perceptions that have disappeared) means having entered any of the four formless states. Of these four explanations, the last is the least likely, for as the next lines show, this passage is describing the stage of concentration practice in which one is transcending the fourth jhāna and entering the formless attainment of the infinitude of space. A more likely explanation of “percipient of what’s disappeared” would be the act of holding to perceptions of the breath and of pleasure and pain, even though these phenomena have all disappeared in the fourth jhāna (see SN 36:11, AN 9:31, AN 10:20, and AN 10:72).
              3. This is the point where the meditator leaves the fourth jhāna and enters the perception of the infinitude of space.
              4. Objectification-classifications (papañca-saṅkhā): Nd I defines papañca simply as craving, views, and conceit. A survey of how the term papañca is actually used in the suttas, however, shows that it denotes the mind’s tendency to objectify itself as a being. Then, from that objectification, it searches for nourishment to keep that being in existence, classifying experience in terms conducive to that search and thus giving rise to conflict. As Sn 4:14 points out, the root of the objectification-classifications is the perception, “I am the thinker.” For further discussion of this point, see note 1 to that sutta and the introduction to MN 18.
              5. “Spirit” is the usual rendering of the Pali word, yakkha. According to Nd I, however, in this context the word yakkha means person, individual, human being, or living being.
              6. In other words, the sage knows that both groups in the previous verse fall back on their knowledge as a measure of the goal, without comprehending the dependency still latent in their knowledge. The sages in the first group are mistaking the experience of neither perception nor non-perception as the goal, and so they are still dependent on that state of concentration. The sages in the second group, by the fact that they claim to be skilled, show that there is still a latent conceit in their experience of not-clinging, and thus it is not totally independent of clinging. (For more on this point, see MN 102.) Both groups still maintain the concept of a “spirit” that is purified in the realization of purity. Once these dependencies are comprehended, one gains release from disputes and from states of becoming and not-becoming. It is in this way that knowledge is a means to the goal, but the goal itself is not measured or defined in terms of knowledge.",: DN 21; Ud 2:4

              “Dwelling on
              their own views,
              quarreling,
              different skilled people say:
              ‘Whoever knows this, understands Dhamma.
              Whoever rejects this, is
              imperfect.’
              Thus quarreling, they dispute:
              ‘My opponent’s a fool & unskilled.’
              Which of these statements is true
              when all of them say they are skilled?”
              
                “If, in not accepting
                an opponent’s doctrine,
                one’s a fool, a beast of inferior discernment,
                then all are fools of inferior discernment—
                all of these
                who dwell on their views.
                But if, in siding with a view,
                one’s cleansed,
                with discernment made pure,
                sensible, skilled,
                then none of them
                are of inferior discernment,
                for all of them
                have their own views.
              
              
                I don’t say, ‘That’s how it is,’
                the way fools tell one another.
                They each make out their views to be true
                and so regard their opponents as fools.”
              
              
                “What some say is true
                —’That’s how it is’—
                others say is ‘falsehood, a lie.’
                Thus quarreling, they dispute.
                Why can’t contemplatives
                say one thing & the same?”
              
              
                “The truth is one,1
                there is no second
                about which a person who knows it
                would argue with one who knows.
                Contemplatives promote
                their various own truths,
                that’s why they don’t say
                one thing & the same.”
              
              
                “But why do they say
                various truths,
                those who say they are skilled?
                Have they learned many various truths
                or do they follow conjecture?”
              
              
                “Apart from their perception
                there are no
                many
                various
                constant truths
                in the world.2
                Theorizing conjectures
                with regard to views,
                they speak of a pair: true
                & false.
                Dependent on what’s seen,
                heard,
                & sensed,
                dependent on habits & practices,
                one shows disdain [for others].
                Taking a stance on his decisions,
                praising himself, he says,
                ‘My opponent’s a fool & unskilled.’
                That by which
                he regards his opponents as fools
                is that by which
                he says he is skilled.
                Calling himself skilled,
                he despises another
                who speaks the same way.
              
              
                Agreeing on a view gone out of bounds,
                drunk with conceit, imagining himself perfect,
                he has consecrated, with his own mind,
                himself
                as well as his view.
              
              
                If, by an opponent’s word,
                one’s inferior,
                the opponent’s
                of inferior discernment as well.
                But if, by one’s own word
                one’s an attainer-of-knowledge, enlightened,
                no one
                among contemplatives
                is a fool.
              
              
                ‘Those who approve of a doctrine other than this
                are lacking in purity,
                imperfect.’
                That’s what the many sectarians say,
                for they’re smitten with passion
                for their own views.
                ‘Only here is there purity,’
                that’s what they say.
                ‘In no other doctrine
                is purity,’ they say.
                That’s how the many sectarians
                are entrenched,
                speaking firmly there
                concerning their own path.
                Speaking firmly concerning your own path,
                what opponent here would you take as a fool?
                You’d simply bring strife on yourself
                if you said your opponent’s a fool
                with an impure doctrine.
              
              
                Taking     a stance on your decisions,
                & yourself as your measure,
                you dispute further down
                into the world.
              
              
                But a person who’s abandoned
                all decisions
                creates no strife
                in the world.”

              1. “The truth is one”: This statement should be kept in mind throughout the following verses, as it forms the background to the discussion of how people who theorize their conjectures speak of the pair, true and false. The Buddha is not denying that there is such a thing as true and false, or that some statements correspond more truly to reality than others. He avoids defending his own teachings in debates, not because there are many different truths, but because—as he says in Sn 4:8, the purpose of debates is not to arrive at truth but to gain praise. In this way, it encourages the debater to get entrenched in his views. All entrenched views, regardless of how true or false their content might be, behave in line with the truth of conditioned phenomena as explained in the preceding sutta. They lead to conceit, conflict, and states of becoming. When they are viewed in this way—as events in a causal chain rather than as true or false depictions of other events (or as events rather than signs)—the tendency to hold to or become entrenched in them is diminished. This allows for a practitioner to hold to the truths of right view for the sake of putting an end to suffering and stress, and then to put aside any attachment to those truths once they have performed their duty. On this point, see MN 22 and AN 10:93, and the essay, “Truths with Consequences.”

              “Those who, dwelling on views,
              dispute, saying, ‘Only this is true’:
              Do they all incur blame,
              or also earn praise there?”
              
                “[The praise:] It’s such a small thing,
                not at all appeasing.1
                I speak of two fruits of dispute;
                and seeing this, you shouldn’t dispute—
                seeing the state
                where there’s no dispute

                at all.
                One who’s uninvolved:
                When he’s forming no predilection
                for what’s seen, for what’s heard,
                why would he get
                involved?2
              
              
                Those for whom habits 
                are ultimate
                say that purity’s
                a matter of self-restraint.
                Undertaking a practice,
                they devote themselves to it:
                ‘Let’s train just in this,
                and then there would be purity.’
                Those who say they are skilled
                are [thus] led on to becoming.
                But if one of them falls
                from his habits or practice,
                he trembles,
                having failed in his actions.
                He hopes for, longs for, purity,
                like a caravan leader     lost

                each saying his agreed-on opinion
                is true.
                If something, because of an opponent’s say-so,
                were lowly,
                then none among teachings would be
                superlative,
                for many say
                that another’s teaching’s inferior
                when firmly asserting their own.
                If their worship of their teaching were true,
                in line with the way they praise their own path,
                then all doctrines
                would be true—
                for purity’s theirs, according to each.
              
              
                The brahman has nothing

                among doctrines.
                Thus he has gone
                beyond disputes,
                for he doesn’t regard as best

                in connection with something
                or somebody     else.
                A person, in seeing,
                sees name-&-form.
                Having seen, he’ll know
                only these things.
                No matter if he’s seen little, a lot,
                the skilled don’t say purity’s
                in connection with that.
              
              
                A person entrenched in his teachings,
                preferring a theorized view,
                isn’t easy to discipline.
                Whatever he depends on
                he describes it as lovely,
                says     that it’s purity,
                that there he saw truth.
              
              
                The brahman, evaluating,
                doesn’t enter into a theory,
                doesn’t follow views,
                isn’t tied even to knowledge.9
                And on knowing
                whatever’s conventional, commonplace,
                he remains equanimous:
                ‘That’s what others hold onto.’
              
              
                Having untied the knots
                here in the world,
                the sage here in the world10
                doesn’t follow a faction
                when disputes have arisen.
                At peace among those not at peace,
                he’s equanimous, doesn’t hold on:
                ‘That’s what others hold onto.’
              
              
                Giving up old effluents,
                not forming new,
                neither pursuing desire,
                nor entrenched in his teachings,
                he’s totally released
                from viewpoints,
                enlightened.
              
              
                He doesn’t adhere to the world,
                is without self-rebuke;
                is enemy-free11
                with regard to all things
                seen, heard, or sensed.
              
              
                His burden laid down,
                the sage totally released

              1. Or: Not enough to appease (the defilements, says Nd I).
              2. A Sanskrit version of this verse is quoted by Asaṅga in the Bodhisattvabhūmi (48.24).
              3. Nd I: Abandoning habits & practices in the sense of no longer believing that purity is measured in terms of them, the view discussed in the preceding verse. See MN 79.
              4. Nd I: “Blamable, blameless” = black and white kamma (see AN 4:232, 234, 237–238, quoted in The Wings to Awakening, section I/B.
              5. Nd I: Having abandoned impure mental qualities, and having fully attained the goal, the arahant has no need to hope for anything at all. 
              6. “In kindness & peace, without taking up peace”—a pun on the word, santimanuggahaya.
              7. The word bhavabhavesu—”through/for becoming & not-becoming”—functions here as a lamp.
              8. “The knowledge of a doctrine, any other doctrine”—a pun on the word, dhammamaññam. Nd I favors the second interpretation, saying that the brahman does not see as best any doctrine aside from the Wings to Awakening: the establishings of mindfulness, the exertions, the bases of power, the faculties, the strengths, the factors for awakening, and the noble eightfold path. This reading seems unlikely, though, as these doctrines are not mentioned anywhere in this poem. The first reading is more in line with the Buddha’s statement in Sn 4:9 that the highest state is not defined in terms of knowledge, and is well-illustrated in action in AN 10:93.
              9. According to Nd I, this compound—ñāṇa-bandhu—should be translated as “tied by means of knowledge,” in that the arahant doesn’t use the knowledge that comes with the mastery of concentration, the five mundane forms of psychic power (abhiñña), or any wrong knowledge to create the bonds of craving or views. However, the compound may also refer to the fact that the arahant isn’t tied even to the knowledge that forms part of the path to arahantship (see MN 117). 
              10. “In the world” functions as a lamp here.
              11. See Sn 4:4, note 9.
              12. “Is improper :: is free from theories, hasn’t stopped :: isn’t impassioned, isn’t worth wanting :: doesn’t desire”—a series of puns—na kappiyo, nuparato, na patthiyo—each with a strongly positive and a strongly negative meaning, probably meant for their shock value. For a similar set of puns, see Dhp 97.",: MN 24; AN 4:24

              about seclusion & the state of peace.
              Seeing in what way is a monk unbound,
              clinging to nothing in the world?”
              
                “He should put an entire stop
                to the root of objectification-classifications:
              
              
                ‘I am the thinker.’1
              
              
                He should train, always mindful,
                to subdue any craving inside him.
                Whatever truth he may know,
                within or without,
                he shouldn’t, because of it,
                make himself hardened,
                for that isn’t called
                unbinding by the good.
                He shouldn’t, because of it, think himself
                better,
                lower, or
                equal.
                Touched by contact in various ways,
                he shouldn’t keep theorizing about self.
                Stilled right within,
                a monk shouldn’t seek peace from another,
                from anything else.
                For one stilled right within,
                there’s nothing embraced,
                so how rejected?2
              
              
                As in the middle of the sea
                it is still,
                with no waves upwelling,
                so the monk—unperturbed, still—
                should not swell himself
                anywhere.”

                the Dhamma he’s witnessed,
                subduing danger.
                Now tell us, sir, the practice:
                the Pāṭimokkha & concentration.”
              
              
                “One shouldn’t be careless with his eyes,
                should close his ears to village-talk,

                or view anything in the world
                as mine.
                When touched by contact,
                he shouldn’t lament,
                shouldn’t covet anywhere any
                states of becoming,
                or tremble at terrors.
                When gaining food & drink,
                staples & cloth,
                he should not make a hoard.
                Nor should he be upset
                when receiving no gains.
                Doing jhāna,           not footloose,
                he should refrain     from restlessness,
                shouldn’t be     heedless,
                should live     in a noise-less abode.
                Not making much of sleep,
                ardent, given to wakefulness,
                he should abandon weariness, deception,
                laughter, sports,
                sexual intercourse,
                & all that goes with it;
                should not practice casting spells,3
                interpret dreams, physical marks,
                the stars, animal cries;
                should not be devoted to
                doing cures or inducing fertility.
              
              
                A monk shouldn’t tremble at blame
                or grow haughty with praise;
                should dispel stinginess, greed,
                divisive speech, anger;
                shouldn’t buy or sell
                or revile anyone anywhere;
                shouldn’t linger in villages,
                or flatter people in hope of gains.
              
              
                A monk shouldn’t boast
                or speak with ulterior motive,
                shouldn’t train in insolence
                or speak quarrelsome words;
                shouldn’t engage in lies
                or knowingly cheat;
                shouldn’t despise others for their

                Annoyed on hearing many words
                from contemplatives
                or ordinary people,
                he shouldn’t respond harshly,
                for those who retaliate
                aren’t calm.
              
              
                Knowing this teaching,
                a monk inquiring
                should always
                train in it mindfully.
                Knowing unbinding as peace,
                he shouldn’t be heedless
                of Gotama’s message—
                for he, the Conqueror unconquered,
                witnessed the Dhamma,
                not by hearsay,
                but directly, himself.
                So, heedful, you
                should always do homage & train
                in line with that Blessed One’s message,”
              
              
                the Blessed One said.4

              1. On objectification-classifications and their role in leading to conflict, see Sn 4:11 and the introduction to MN 18. The perception, “I am the thinker” lies at the root of these classifications in that it identifies oneself as a being. Because a being requires food, both physical and mental (see SN 12:63–64 and Khp 4), this creates conflict with others seeking food. Because an identity as a being also involves attachment (see SN 23:2), this perception involves internal conflict as well, as whatever one identifies with will inevitably change. The conceit inherent in this perception thus forms a fetter on the mind. To become unbound, one must learn to examine this perception—to see that it is simply an assumption that is not inherent in experience, and that we would be better off learning how to drop it.
              2. This reading follows the version of the verse given in the Thai edition of Nd I, as well as an alternative reading given as a footnote to the Sri Lankan edition of Sn 4:14: n’atthi attaṁ kuto nirattaṁ vā. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions of this verse read, n’atthi attā kuto nirattā vā: “There is no self, so how what’s opposed to self?” The Thai edition of Sn 4:14 reads, n’atthi attā kuto nirattaṁ vā: “There is no self, so how what’s rejected?” This last reading makes no sense; the Burmese and Sri Lankan readings depend on the notion that nirattā is an actual word, although it appears nowhere in the Canon except in two other verses of the Aṭṭhaka Vagga, where it is cited as a possible alternative to niratta (Sn 4:3 and Sn 4:10). Because the Buddha in SN 44:10 refuses to take the position that there is no self, and because he says in MN 2 that the questions, “Do I exist? Do I not exist?” are unworthy of attention, all of the readings of this verse that say n’atthi attā would appear to be wrong. Thus I have adopted the reading given here. 
              3. Āthabbaṇa. Some scholars have identified this term with the Atharvaveda, but the identification is uncertain. It could also be a generic term for casting spells and curses of any sort. Nd I interprets this term simply as referring to spells for bringing about calamities and diseases for one’s enemies.
              4. The Chinese version of the Aṭṭhaka Vagga adds, at the end of this sutta, the verses in Sn 1:9.",: DN 2

              “When embraced,
              the rod of violence1
              breeds danger & fear:
              Look at people in strife.
              I will tell how
              I experienced
              terror:
              Seeing people floundering
              like fish in small puddles,
              competing with one another—
              as I saw this,
              fear came into me.
              The world was entirely
              without substance.
              All the directions
              were knocked out of line.
              Wanting a haven for myself,
              I saw nothing that wasn’t laid claim to.
              Seeing nothing in the end
              but competition,
              I felt discontent.
              And then I saw
              an arrow here,
              so very hard to see,
              embedded in the heart.
              Overcome by this arrow
              you run in all directions.
              But simply on pulling it out
              you don’t run,
              you don’t sink.2
              
                [Here the trainings are recited.] 3
              
              
                Whatever things are tied down in the world,
                you shouldn’t be set on them.
                Having totally penetrated
                sensual pleasures,
                sensual passions,4
                you should train for your own
                unbinding.
              
              
                Be truthful, not insolent,
                not deceptive, remote
                from divisiveness.
                Without anger, the sage
                should cross over the evil
                of greed & avarice.
                He should conquer drowsiness,
                weariness,
                sloth;
                shouldn’t consort with heedlessness,
                shouldn’t stand firm in his pride—
                the man with his heart set
                on unbinding.
              
              
                He shouldn’t engage in lying,
                shouldn’t create affection for form,
                should fully fathom conceit,
                and live refraining from impulsiveness;
                shouldn’t          delight in what’s old,
                prefer what’s new,5
                grieve over decline,
                get entangled in
                what’s dazzling & bright.6
              
              
                I call greed
                a great flood;
                hunger, a swift current.
                Preoccupations are ripples;
                sensuality, a bog
                hard to cross over.
                Not deviating from truth,
                a sage stands on high ground
                : a brahman.7
              
              
                Having relinquished
                in every way,
                he is said to be
                at peace;
                having clearly known, he
                is an attainer-of-knowledge;
                knowing the Dhamma, he’s
                independent.
                Moving rightly through the world,
                he doesn’t envy
                anyone here.
              
              
                Whoever here has gone beyond
                sensual passions—
                an attachment hard
                to transcend in the world—
                doesn’t sorrow,
                doesn’t fret.
                He, his stream8 cut, is free
                from bonds.
              
              
                Burn up what’s before,
                and have nothing for after.
                If you don’t grasp
                at what’s in between,9
                you will go about, calm.
              
              
                For whom, in name-&-form,
                in every way,
                there’s no sense of mine,
                and who doesn’t grieve
                over what is not:
                He, in the world,
                isn’t defeated,
                suffers no loss.10
              
              
                To whom there doesn’t occur
                ‘This is mine,’
                for whom nothing is others’:
                He, feeling no sense of mine-ness,
                doesn’t grieve at the thought
                ‘I have nothing.’
              
              
                Not harsh,
                not greedy,
                not perturbed,11
                everywhere
                concordant12:
                This is the reward
                —I say when asked—
                for those who are free
                from theorizing.
              
              
                For one unperturbed
                —who knows—
                there’s no accumulating.
                Abstaining, unaroused,
                he everywhere sees
                security.13
                The sage
                doesn’t speak of himself
                as among those who are higher,
                equal,
                or lower.
                At peace, free of stinginess,
                he doesn’t embrace, doesn’t
                reject,”

              1. Nd I: The rod of violence takes three forms: physical violence (the three forms of bodily misconduct), verbal violence (the four forms of verbal misconduct), and mental violence (the three forms of mental misconduct). See AN 10:176 and Dhp 129–142. 
              2. Nd I: “One doesn’t run” to any of the destinations of rebirth; “one doesn’t sink” into any of the four floods of sensuality, views, becoming, and ignorance. See SN 1:1, SN 45:171, and AN 4:10.
              3. This phrase, a kind of stage direction, seems to indicate that this poem had a ritual use, as part of a ceremony for giving the precepts.
              4. “Sensual pleasure, sensual passions”: two meanings of the word kāma.
              5. Nd I: “Old” and “new” mean past and present aggregates.
              6. Nd I: “what’s dazzling & bright” = craving and other defilements.
              7. See AN 7:15.
              8. Nd I: The stream here stands for craving and the various defilements that arise in its wake. See Dhp 251, 337, 339­–340, and 347. It could also stand for the stream of becoming, mentioned in Sn 3:12.
              9. Nd I: “Before,” “after,” and “in between” = past, future, and present.
              10. “Isn’t defeated, suffers no loss”—two meanings of the Pali phrase, na jiyyati.
              11. Nd I defines “perturbation” as meaning “craving,” and “unperturbed” as meaning unmoved by gain, loss, status, loss of status, praise, criticism, pleasure, or pain (see AN 8:6–7). However, when the Buddha discusses the meaning of “unperturbed” in Sn 5:3, he relates it to the practice of concentration. See Sn 5:3, note 5.

              of a teacher with such lovely speech
              come, together with his following

                —there in his noiseless abode—
                how many the dangers in the world
                for the monk          going the direction
                he never has gone
                over which he should prevail
                there in his isolated abode?
                What should be
                the ways of his speech?
                What should be
                his range there of action?
                What should be
                a resolute monk’s
                habits & practices?2
                Undertaking what training
                — mindful, astute, alone —
                would he blow away
                his own impurities
                as a silver smith,
                those in molten silver?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “I will tell you
                as one who knows,
                what is comfort
                for one disaffected
                if he’s resorting to a place remote,
                desiring self-awakening
                in line with the Dhamma.
                An enlightened monk,
                living circumscribed,
                mindful,
                shouldn’t fear the five fears:
                of horseflies, mosquitoes, snakes,
                human contact, four-footed beings;
                shouldn’t be fazed
                by those following another’s teaching
                even on seeing their manifold
                threats;
                should prevail over still other
                further dangers
                as he seeks what is skillful.
              
              
                Touched
                by the touch
                of disease, hunger,
                he should endure cold
                & inordinate heat.
                He with no home,
                in many ways touched by these things,
                striving, should make firm his persistence.
              
              
                He shouldn’t commit a theft,
                shouldn’t speak a lie,
                should touch with thoughts of goodwill
                beings firm & infirm.
                Conscious of when
                his mind is stirred up & turbid,
                he should dispel it:
                ‘It’s on the side
                of the Dark One.’
              
              
                He shouldn’t come under the sway
                of anger or pride.
                Having dug up their root
                he would stand firm.
                Then, when prevailing
                —yes—
                he’d prevail over notions of dear & undear.
              
              
                Deferring          to discernment
                enraptured          with what’s admirable,
                he should overcome these dangers,
                should conquer
                discontent
                in his isolated spot,
                should conquer
                these four
                thoughts of lament:
              
              
                ‘What will I eat,
                or where will I eat?
                How badly I slept.
                Tonight where will I sleep?’
              
              
                These lamenting thoughts
                he should subdue—
                one under training,
                wandering without home.
                Receiving food & cloth
                at appropriate times,
                he should have a sense of enough
                for the sake of contentment.3
                Guarded in regard to these things
                going restrained into a village,
                even when harassed
                he shouldn’t say a harsh word.
              
              
                With eyes downcast,
                & not footloose,
                committed to jhāna,
                he should be continually wakeful.4
                Arousing equanimity,
                centered within,
                he should cut off any penchant
                to conjecture or worry.
                When reprimanded with words,
                he should—mindful—
                rejoice;5
                should smash any rigidity
                toward his fellows in the holy life;
                should utter skillful words
                that are not untimely;
                should give no mind
                to the gossip people might say.
              
              
                And then there are in the world
                the five kinds of dust
                for whose subduing, mindful,
                he should train:
                With regard to forms, sounds, tastes,
                smells, & tactile sensations
                he should conquer passion;
                with regard to these things
                he should subdue his desire.
              
              
                A monk, mindful,
                his mind well released,
                contemplating the right Dhamma
                at the right times,
                on coming
                to oneness6
                should annihilate
                darkness,”

            Prologue
            
              From the delightful city of the Kosalans,
              a brahman [Bāvarī]
              who had mastered mantras,
              aspiring to nothingness,1
              went to the Southern country.
              He, in the land of Assaka,
              the neighborhood of Muḷaka,
              on the bank of the Godhāvarī,
              lived on gleanings & fruits.
              Close by was a large village.
              And with the income from that village
              he performed a great sacrifice.
              Having sacrificed the great sacrifice,
              he returned again to his ashram.
              
                As soon as he had entered there,
                another brahman came along:
                thirsty, with
                scratched feet,
                dirty teeth,
                dusty head.
                On arrival, he asked Bāvarī
                for five hundred [pieces of money].
                Bāvarī, on seeing him, invited him to sit down,
                asked after what is pleasant & skillful,
                and said these words:
                “Whatever of mine
                that could be given away,
                I have disposed of entirely.
                Forgive me, brahman,
                I don’t have five hundred.”
              
              
                “If you don’t hand over
                to me when I ask,
                within seven days,
                may your head split
                into seven pieces.”
              
              
                Dissembling, the imposter
                proclaimed threats.
                Hearing his words,
                Bāvarī was distressed.
                He wasted away, taking no food,
                afflicted with the arrow of grief,
                and, with his mind this way,
                his heart found no delight in jhāna.
              
              
                Seeing him nervous & distressed,
                a devatā wishing his welfare,
                approached Bāvarī
                and said these words:
                “That imposter, wanting money,
                doesn’t discern heads;
                has no knowledge of heads
                or the splitting of heads.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “You, sir, surely know.
                Explain to me when asked:
                heads & the splitting of heads.
                I will listen to your words.”
              
              
                The devatā:
                “I too don’t know that.
                I don’t have that knowledge.
                Heads & the splitting of heads:
                That is surely the insight of Victors.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “Then who knows surely
                in this circle of the earth,
                heads & the splitting of heads?
                Explain that to me, devatā.”
              
              
                The devatā:
                “Gone forth from the city of Kapilavatthu,
                the chief of the world,
                a descendant of King Okkāka,
                a Sakyan-son, a bringer of light:
                He, brahman, is Rightly Self-Awakened,
                gone to the far shore of all
                dhammas;
                attainer of all
                direct knowledges & strengths,
                one with an Eye that sees all
                dhammas;
                attainer of the end of all
                action,
                released in the ending of acquisitions.
                He, the One with Eyes,
                awakened, blessed,
                teaches the Dhamma.
                Going to him, you ask him.
                He will answer you.”
              
              
                Hearing the word “Self-Awakened,”
                Bāvarī was exultant.
                His grief subsided,
                and he gained abundant rapture.
                So Bāvarī, gratified, exultant,
                excited, asked the devatā:
                “In which village or town,
                or in which country
                is the protector of the world?
                Going where can we pay homage
                to the Self-Awakened One,
                supreme among two-footed beings?”
              
              
                The devatā:
                “In Sāvatthī, the Kosalan city,
                is the Victor of vast discernment,
                of foremost deep intelligence.
                He, a matchless Sakyan-son,
                effluent-free, a bull among men,
                is an expert in the splitting of heads.”
                Then Bāvarī addressed his students,
                brahmans who had mastered the mantras,
                “Come, students, I will explain.
                Listen to my words.
                He whose appearance in the world
                is hard often to gain,
                has today arisen          in the world,
                renowned as Self-Awakened.
                Going quickly to Sāvatthī,
                see the one supreme
                among two-footed beings.”
              
              
                The students:
                “But how, brahman, on seeing him,
                will we know for sure
                that he’s the One Self-Awakened?
                Tell us, who don’t know,
                how we will know him.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “There have come down in the mantras
                the marks of a Great Man.
                Thirty-two are described in all,
                step by step.
                One in whose body
                are the marks of a Great Man
                has two destinations.
                There isn’t a third.
                If he dwells in a home,
                he will conquer this world
                —without rod, without sword,
                but with righteousness—
                he will rule.
                But if he goes forth
                from home into homelessness,
                with his roof opened up,2
                he will be      Self-Awakened,
                a worthy one     unexcelled.
                Ask just in your heart
                about my caste & clan,
                mantras, other students,
                and about heads
                & the splitting of heads.
                If he is awakened,
                seeing without obstruction,
                he will answer     in speech
                the questions asked     in your heart.”
              
              
                Having heard Bāvarī’s words,
                sixteen brahman students—
                Ajita, Tissa-metteyya,
                Puṇṇaka & Mettagū,
                Dhotaka & Upasīva,
                Nanda & Hemaka,
                Todeyya & Kappa,
                the wise Jatukaṇṇin,
                Bhadrāvudha & Udaya,
                Posāla the brahman,
                Mogharāja the intelligent,
                and Piṅgiya the great seer—
                all          with their own groups,
                famed in          all
                the world,
                endowed          with jhāna,
                delighting          in jhāna,
                enlightened,
                perfume          with perfumes3
                from previous lives,
                having bowed down to Bāvarī
                and performed circumambulation,
                left, setting out for the North,
                wearing coiled hair & deer-skins:
                first to the establishment of Muḷaka,
                then to Māhissatī, Ujjenī, Gonaddhā,
                Vedisā, Vanasa,
                to Kosambī & Sāketa,
                to Sāvatthī, the supreme city,
                to Setabya, Kapilavatthu,
                the city of Kusinārā,
                to Pāva, Bhoganagara,
                to Vesālī, the city of the Magadhans,
                and then to the Pāsāṇaka shrine,
                refreshing & lovely.
              
              
                Like a thirsty man     for cool water,
                like a merchant     for a great profit,
                like one burning from heat
                for shade,
                quickly they climbed the mountain.
                And at that time, the Blessed One,
                surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks,
                was teaching the monks the Dhamma,
                like a lion roaring in the forest.
                Ajita saw the Self-Awakened One,
                like the sun with radiance in beams,4
                like the moon come to fullness
                on the fifteenth day.
                Then, seeing the marks
                complete in his body,
                he stood to one side, overjoyed,
                and in his heart asked the questions:
              
              
                “Speak concerning his birth,
                speak of his clan & marks,
                speak of his perfection in the mantras,
                and how many brahmans
                does he teach?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “His age is one hundred & twenty,
                and by clan, he is a Bāvarī.
                Three are the marks in his body,
                three the Vedas he’s mastered.
                In the marks & oral traditions,
                etymologies & rituals,
                he teaches five hundred.
                In his own doctrine
                he has reached perfection.”
              
              
                Ajita:
                “Proclaim them in detail—
                Bāvarī’s marks—
                O man supreme,
                cutter of craving,
                don’t leave us in doubt.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “He can hide his face with his tongue,
                he has a tuft of hair between his brows,
                his male organ is in a sheath:
                Know this, young brahman.”
              
              
                Not hearing anything asked,
                but hearing the questions answered,
                all the people, excited,
                with hands palm-to-palm over their hearts,
                thought:
                “What deva or Brahmā,
                or Inda Sujampati5
                asked those questions in his heart?
                To whom did he [the Buddha] reply?”
              
              
                Ajita:
                “Bāvarī asked about heads
                and the splitting of heads.
                Explain that, Blessed One.
                Subdue our doubt, seer.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Know the head to be ignorance,
                and the splitting of the head, knowledge
                connected with conviction,
                mindfulness, concentration,
                desire, & persistence.”
              
              
                Then, with great joy,
                the young brahman,
                putting himself in order,
                arranging his deer-skin over one shoulder,
                fell with his head at the Blessed One’s feet:
                “Master, One with Eyes,
                Bāvarī the brahman,
                together with his students, dear sir—
                exultant in mind, happy at heart—
                venerate your feet.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “May he be happy,
                Bāvarī the brahman,
                together with his students.
                And may you, too, be happy,
                young brahman,
                and live a long time.
                All doubts—
                Bāvarī’s
                and all of yours:
                Ask, now that I’ve given leave,
                whatever you wish in your heart.”
              
              
                Given leave by the Self-Awakened One,
                having sat to one side, hands palm-to-palm
                over his heart,
                Ajita there addressed the first question
                to the Tathāgata.

              1. Reading ākiñcāññaṁ with the Thai text of Nd II and of SnA. The Thai text of the prologue here reads āciññaṁ, “practice, custom.” According to SnA, “nothingness” here means freedom from care. However, it might also mean the meditative state of the dimension of nothingness, and the post-mortem deva realm corresponding to that attainment. This would fit in with the fact that, in the following dialogues, two of his students—Upasīva and Posāla—appear to be familiar with this dimension in their meditation, and quiz the Buddha as to what to do after having attained it.
              2. See Sn 2:13, note 3.
              3. “Perfume” (vāsanā) here means traces of good qualities.

              1. The Thai edition notes that this word, in terms of the meter of the line, is excessive.
              2. According to Nd II, the streams that ‘flow every which way’ are the streams of craving, views, conceit, defilement, corruption, and ignorance that flow out the six sense media. The first two lines in the translation of Ven. Ajita’s second set of questions (the first half-line in the Pali) is identical to the first half-line in Dhp 340.
              3. See DN 11, DN 15, MN 49, and SN 12:67. Asaṅga, in the Yogācārabhūmi, quotes a Sanskrit translation of this sutta that inserts at this point the final question and answer, on the topic of how consciousness is brought to a halt, occurring at the end of the Pali version of Sn 5:14. A manuscript found in Turfan contains a Sanskrit version of this sutta that inserts the same question at the same point, and includes traces of other insertions as well.
              4. In SN 12:31, the Buddha quotes this question to Ven. Sāriputta and asks him to answer it. With a little prodding, Ven. Sāriputta gives this extended answer, on which the Buddha places his seal of approval:
              “One sees with right discernment that ‘this has come into being.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘this has come into being,’ one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of what has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment,’ one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of the nutriment by which it has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation,’ one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of what is subject to cessation. This is how one is a learner.
              “And how is one a person who has fathomed the Dhamma?
              “One sees with right discernment that ‘this has come into being.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘this has come into being,’ one is—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, through lack of clinging/sustenance—released from what has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment,’ one is—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, through lack of clinging/sustenance—released from the nutriment by which it has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation,’ one is—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, through lack of clinging/sustenance—released from what is subject to cessation. This is how one is a person who has fathomed the Dhamma.”",No Additional

              1. AN 6:61 reports a discussion among several elder monks as to what is meant in this poem by “both sides” and “in between.” Six of the elders express the following separate opinions:
              a) Contact is the first side, the origination of contact the second side, and the cessation of contact is in between.
              b) The past is the first side, the future the second, and the present is in between.
              c) Pleasant feeling is the first side, painful feeling the second, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling is in between.
              d) Name (mental phenomena) is the first side, form (physical phenomena) the second, and consciousness is in between.
              e) The six internal sense media (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, intellect) are the first side, the six external sense media (sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, tactile sensations, ideas) the second side, and consciousness is in between.
              f) Self-identity is the first side, the origination of self-identity the second, and the cessation of self-identity is in between.
              The issue is then taken to the Buddha, who states that all six interpretations are well-spoken, but the interpretation he had in mind when speaking the poem was the first.

            vv. 1043–1048",No Introduction,"s
              1. Nd II cites three main ways in which the Buddha has seen the roots: 
              a) He has seen that greed, aversion, and delusion are the roots of what is unskillful, and that lack of greed, lack of aversion, and lack of delusion are the roots of what is skillful. Nd II anchors this point with a reference to AN 6:39, although its quote from that sutta contains two phrases not present in the sutta. Where AN 6:39 reads, “It’s through action born of non-greed, action born of non-aversion, action born of non-delusion that devas are discerned, that human beings are discerned, or any other good destinations,” Nd II reads, “It’s through action born of non-greed, action born of non-aversion, action born of non-delusion that devas are discerned, that human beings are discerned, or any other good destinations for the production of a self-state [attabhāva] in a deva or a human being.” Where AN 6:39 reads, “It’s through action born of greed, action born of aversion, action born of delusion that hell is discerned, that the animal womb is discerned, that the realm of hungry ghosts is discerned, or any other bad destinations,” Nd II reads “It’s through action born of greed, action born of aversion, action born of delusion that hell is discerned, that the animal womb is discerned, that the realm of hungry ghosts is discerned, or any other bad destinations for the production of a self-state in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry ghosts.” If we assume that the extra phrases were originally not present in AN 6:39, the question arises as to why they were added in Nd II. One possible reason is that the compilers of Nd II may have been bothered by AN 6:39’s suggestion that its list of good and bad destinations was not complete—e.g., that there could be other good destinations aside from the realms of devas and human beings—so they tried to close off that possibility.
              b) The Buddha has seen further that all unskillful qualities are rooted in ignorance (here Nd II quotes a passage from SN 20:1: “All qualities that are unskillful, that have a share in what’s unskillful, that side with what’s unskillful, are rooted in ignorance and converge in ignorance. From the uprooting of ignorance, they are all uprooted”). The Buddha has also seen that all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness (here Nd II quotes a passage found in SN 45:79–80, SN 45:82, and SN 46:31: “All qualities that are skillful, that have a share in what’s skillful, that side with what’s skillful, are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is foremost among them”). 
              c) The Buddha has also seen that ignorance is the root of all the factors of dependent co-arising. 
              For another sense in which the Buddha has seen the root, see MN 1. 
              2. See Sn 3:4 for another answer to a very similar question.
              3. On the issue of rebirth in the suttas, see The Truth of Rebirth.
              4. According to Nd II, this means that one’s bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct have evaporated away, along with all one’s defilements.
              5. AN 3:32 and AN 4:41 contain discussions of the last verse in this poem. 
              In AN 3:32, Ven. Ānanda asks the Buddha, “Could it be that a monk could attain a concentration of such a sort such that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, and that he would enter & remain in the awareness-release & discernment-release in which there is no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit?”
              The Buddha answers that it is possible, and that such a concentration can be attained when one is percipient in this way: “This is peace, this is exquisite—the pacification of all fabrications; the relinquishing of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; unbinding.” He then adds that it was in connection to this state of mind that he uttered the last verse in this poem.
              In AN 4:41, the Buddha identifies four ways of developing concentration: “There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here-&-now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.” The Buddha then adds that he uttered the last verse of this poem in connection with these four ways of developing concentration.
              Although the verse does not mention concentration explicitly, the use of the phrase, “nothing perturbing” is apparently a reference to the states of concentration called imperturbable. See MN 102, note 2, and MN 106, note 1.",No Additional

                The Buddha:
                You ask me
                the source of stress.
                I’ll tell it to you
                as one who discerns.
                From acquisition1 as cause
                the many forms of stress
                come into being in the world.
                Whoever, unknowing,
                makes acquisitions
                —the dullard—
                comes to stress
                again & again.
                Therefore, discerning,
                you shouldn’t create acquisitions
                as you stay focused on
                the birth & origin of stress.2

                Whatever you’re alert to,
                above, below,

                in those things,
                consciousness should not take a stance
                in becoming.4
                The monk who dwells thus

                letting go of his sense of mine,

              a) above = the future; below = the past; across and in between = the present,
              b) above = the deva world; below = hell; across and in between = the human world,

              d) above = the property of formlessness; below = the property of sensuality; across and in between = the property of form,
              e) above = feelings of pleasure; below = feelings of pain; across and in between = feelings of neither pleasure nor pain,
              f) above = the body from the feet on up; below = the body from the crown of the head on down; across and in between = the middle of the body.

              1. “Nothingness” here denotes the dimension of nothingness, one of the four levels of mental absorption on formless themes. One attains this level, after surmounting the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, by focusing on the perception, “There is nothing.” MN 26 tells us that Āḷāra Kālāma, the Buddha’s first teacher when the latter was still a Bodhisatta, had attained this level of mental absorption and had thought that it was the highest possible attainment. The Bodhisatta left him upon realizing that it was not true liberation from stress and suffering. Nevertheless, the dimension of nothingness can be used as a basis for the insight leading to that liberation. On this point, see Sn 5:14, below, and AN 9:36. On the strategy of relying on the formless states to cross over the flood, see MN 52, MN 106, MN 111, and AN 9:36.

                or rejected by you.

                and have nothing for after.
                If you don’t grasp
                at what’s in between,2

              1. According to Nd II, the Buddha is called the Simultaneous Eye because the Eye of his omniscience arose simultaneously with his awakening to Buddhahood. It’s hardly likely, though, that Jatukaṇṇin would have this idea in mind when speaking to the Buddha for the first time. More likely, he might be alluding to the idea that the Buddha is able to see things, and to understand them for what they are, the moment they arise.
              2. According to Nd II, ‘before’ stands for defilements related to the past, ‘after’ for defilements related to the future, and ‘in between’ for the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, thought-fabrications, sensory consciousness—in the present.",No Additional

              1. The state of mind described here corresponds to the five-factored noble right concentration described in AN 5:28, and analyzed more fully in AN 9:36. For further discussion, see section III/F in The Wings to Awakening and the essays, “Jhāna Not by the Numbers” and “Silence Isn’t Mandatory.” 
              2. AN 3:33 contains a discussion of this verse. The Buddha tells Ven. Sāriputta that one should train oneself such that “with regard to this conscious body, there will be no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] there will be no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, and that we will enter & remain in the awareness-release & discernment-release in which there is no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit.” When one has trained in this way, he says, one is called a person who has cut through craving, unraveled the fetter, who has, through the right penetration of conceit, put an end to suffering and stress. He then states that it was in connection to this state that he uttered this verse.
              3. See DN 11, DN 15, MN 49, and SN 12:67. For a discussion of “bringing consciousness to a halt”—showing that it is not an annihilation of consciousness, but rather the ending of its proliferating activity—see SN 22:53.",the image in SN 12:64.

                one then sees there
                clearly.
                That’s his genuine knowledge—

              1. Posāla’s question concerning the knowledge of the person in the dimension of nothingness has a double meaning: He is asking about the Buddha’s knowledge about that person, and also what a person in that dimension of attainment should do to develop his/her knowledge even further. The Buddha’s answer deals with the question in both its senses. On delight in nothingness, see MN 106. 
              2. On the seven stations of consciousness, see DN 15. The dimension of nothingness, discussed in this dialogue, is the seventh and most refined. See Sn 5:6, note 1.

            That is what the Blessed One said when dwelling among the Magadhans at the Pāsāṇaka shrine. Asked in turn by the sixteen brahmans, he answered their questions. And if one were to practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma,1 knowing the meaning and Dhamma of each of these questions, one would go to the far shore of birth & death. Because these Dhammas lead there, this Dhamma-sequence is called “To the Far Shore.”

              asking subtle questions.
              The Awakened One,
              when asked their questions,
              answered in line with the truth.
              By answering their questions, the sage

                Whoever would practice
                as the Awakened One taught
                concerning each of these questions,

                In the past,
                before hearing Gotama’s message,
                when anyone explained ‘It is,’ ‘It will be,’
                all that was hearsay,
                quotation marks.
                All that promoted conjecture
                and gave me no pleasure.5
              
              
                Sitting alone—
                the dispeller of darkness,
                shining, bringer of light,
                Gotama of deep knowledge,
                Gotama of deep intelligence:
                He taught me the Dhamma
                timeless, visible here-&-now,
                the ending of craving,
                calamity-free,
                whose likeness is nowhere at all.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “Piṅgiya, for even a moment
                can you stay apart from him—
                Gotama of deep knowledge,
                Gotama of deep intelligence,
                who taught you the Dhamma
                timeless, visible here-&-now,
                the ending of craving,
                calamity-free,
                whose likeness is nowhere at all?”
              
              
                Ven. Piṅgiya:
                “No, brahman, not even for a moment
                can I stay apart from him—
                Gotama of deep knowledge,
                Gotama of deep intelligence,
                who taught me the Dhamma
                timeless, visible here-&-now,
                the ending of craving,
                calamity-free,
                whose likeness is nowhere at all.
              
              
                I see him with my heart
                as if with my eye—
                heedful, brahman, by day & by night.
                I spend the night paying homage to him,
                and that way, as it were,
                not staying apart.
                My conviction, rapture,
                mindfulness, & heart,
                don’t stray from Gotama’s message.
              
              
                To whatever direction he goes,
                the one deeply discerning,
                to that direction I bow down.
                I am old, my stamina frail,
                which is why my body doesn’t run away to there.
                But through the machine of my resolves
                I constantly go,
                for my heart, brahman, is connected to him.
              
              
                Floundering in the mud,
                I swam from island to island,
                but then I saw the One Self-Awakened,
                crossed over the flood, effluent-free.
              
              
                ‘As Vakkali has shown his conviction6—
                as Bhadrāvudha & Āḷavi Gotama too—
                so will you show your conviction, Piṅgiya.
                You will go beyond the realm of death.’
              
              
                I feel confidence all the more,
                having heard the words of the sage,
                his roof opened-up, self-awakened,
                quick-witted, free from rigidity.
                Knowing the supreme devas,7
                he knows all dhammas, from high to low:
                the Teacher who puts an end
                to the questions
                of those admitting
                their doubt.
              
              
                To the untaken-in, unshaken,8
                whose likeness is nowhere at all:
                Yes, I will go there.
                I’ve no doubt about that.
                Remember me thus
                as one whose mind
                is decided.

              1. See SN 22:39–42.
              2. According to SnA, the sixteen brahmans, after their questions were answered, requested and received the Going-forth and Acceptance. After that, Piṅgiya, now Ven. Piṅgiya, received permission from the Buddha to return to Bāvarī to report the results of their trip.
              3. Reading nikkāmo nibbano nāgo with the Sri Lankan and Burmese versions, a reading confirmed by Nd II. The Thai version has nibbuto, “unbound,” instead of nibbano. The PTS version has nātho, “protector,” instead of nāgo.
              According to Nd II, “no forest” here means free from the forests of passion, aversion, delusion, resentment, and all other unskillful mental fabrications. See Dhp 283.
              4. See SN 35:82, SN 35:116, and AN 4:45.
              5. The phrase, “and gave me no pleasure,” appears in the Thai edition but not the others.
              6. According to Nd IIA, to show conviction means to attain arahantship through the strength of conviction. The expression also occurs in SN 6:1, where it seems to have a more general meaning. Ven. Vakkali’s story appears in SN 22:87. At AN 1:147 (1:208) the Buddha cites him as foremost among the monks in being decisive in his conviction. Bhadrāvudha is apparently the same Bhadrāvudha in Sn 5:12. Āḷavi Gotama is mentioned nowhere else in the Canon.
              7. In AN 8:71 (AN 8:64 in the PTS reckoning), the Buddha states that he did not claim full awakening until his knowledge of the deva world was complete.
