              he came from there.
              Without permission,
              he went from here
              —coming from     where?—
              having stayed a few days.
              And coming one way from here,
              he goes yet another
              from there.
              Dying in the human form,
              he will go wandering on.

Since Vedic times, there has been a belief in India that the eyes of holy individuals where particularly powerful because they could see so deeply into reality. From this belief grew a further belief: that the eyes of such individuals were so powerful that their eyes could transmit some of that power to others. Thus, to be gazed on by such an individual, or to gaze into that individual’s eyes, was considered to be very auspicious.

              So says the tamer of tamable people.
              Being a co-wife is painful.
              Some, on giving birth once,
              slit their throats.
              Others, of delicate constitution,
              take poison.
              In the midst of a breech-birth
              both [mother & child] suffer destruction.
            
            
              Going along, about to give birth,
              I saw my husband       dead.
              Giving birth in the road,
              I hadn’t reached
              my own home.
              Two children deceased,
              my husband dead in the road
              —miserable me!
              My mother, father, & brother
              were burning on a single pyre.
            
            
              “Your family all gone, miserable,
              you’ve suffered pain without measure.
              Your tears have flowed
              for many thousands of lives.”1
            
            
              Then I saw,
              in the midst of the charnel ground,2
              the muscles of sons being chewed.
            
            
              With family killed,
              despised by all,
              my husband dead,
              I reached the deathless.
              I’ve developed this path,
              noble, eightfold,
              going to the deathless.
              Having realized unbinding,
              I’ve gazed in the mirror of Dhamma.
              I’ve extracted the arrow,3
              put down the burden,
              done the task.
            
            
              I, Kīsā Gotamī Therī,
              my heart well released,
              have said this.","Kīsā Gotamī has two of the most heart-rending stories in the Buddhist tradition associated with her name. The Commentary to this verse tells that when her young child had died, she refused to believe it was dead. After asking many people—in vain—for medicine that would revive the child, she was finally directed to the Buddha. When she told him her story, he offered to provide medicine for the child, but he would need some mustard seed—the cheapest Indian spice—obtained from a family in which no one had died. She went from house to house asking for mustard seed, and no one refused to give it to her. But when she asked if anyone had died in the family, the universal response was always, “Oh, yes, of course.” After a while, the message sunk in: Death is universal. On abandoning the child’s body to a charnel ground, she returned to the Buddha and asked to be ordained as a nun, and afterwards became an arahant.
          The canonical verses associated with Kīsā Gotamī’s name, however, tell a different story, which is identical to the story that the Commentary attributes to Paṭācārā: Pregnant with her second child, she was returning to her parents’ home, along with her husband and young firstborn child, to give birth. Along the way, a great storm blew up, and she asked her husband to provide shelter for the family. As he was cutting grass and gathering sticks to build a shelter, a snake bit him and he died of the poison. Unsheltered, and wondering at her husband’s long absence, Paṭācārā gave birth and had to spend the night sheltering both her children against the rain and wind with nothing more than her body. The next morning, she found her husband dead. Distraught, she decided to return to her parents’ home. However, a river—swollen from the rain of the previous night—ran across her way. Unable to carry both children across the river in one trip, she left her first-born on the near bank and waded through the raging current carrying her baby. Placing the baby on the far bank, she turned back to fetch her first-born. A hawk, seeing the baby, took it for a piece of flesh, and swooped down on it. Seeing this, Paṭācārā raised her hands and tried to chase it away, but to no avail: The hawk picked up the baby and carried it off. Meanwhile, her first-born—seeing his mother raising her hands—took it for a signal to cross the river. Jumping into the raging current, he was carried off to his death. Overwhelmed with grief, Paṭācārā returned to her parents’ home, only to learn that it had burned down from a lightning strike in the previous night’s storm. Her parents and brother were at that moment being cremated on a single pyre. At this point, she went mad and began wandering around half-naked. Only on coming into the Buddha’s presence did she recover her senses. He taught her the Dhamma, and eventually she ordained and became an arahant.
          Why this story is attributed to Paṭācārā in the Commentary when it is obviously Kīsā Gotamī’s in the Canon, is hard to tell. Some scholars have suggested that the tales in the Pāli commentaries were imported from other Buddhist traditions, such as the Mūlasarvāstivādin. Thus, the differences between the canonical verses and the commentarial tales stem from the fact that the different traditions attributed particular stories to different elder monks and nuns. For instance, the Pali Canon attributed the story of the woman whose family was destroyed in a single day to Kīsā Gotamī, while the tradition from which the Commentary drew attributed it to Paṭācārā. If that’s the case, it’s interesting to note how the commentators who adopted these tales nevertheless remained faithful to their Canon. Instead of trying to change the Pali to fit with the commentarial source on which they drew, they allowed the discrepancies between the two sources to stand: one of many instances in which the discrepancies between the Canon and the commentaries suggest that the monks who handed down the Pali Canon tried to keep it intact even when they didn’t agree with it.
          Later Theravādin texts have tried to cover over the discrepancies between Kīsā Gotamī’s verses and the Commentary to those verses by insisting that the passage in the verses beginning, “Going along, about to give birth,” and ending, “my husband dead, I reached the deathless,” is actually Paṭācārā speaking, but this seems unlikely: Why would one arahant butt in on another one’s tale?
          At any rate, regardless of which story is Paṭācārā’s, and which Kīsā Gotamī’s, both speak to the universality of death, and the power of the path of practice: that in the midst of this human world with all its sorrows, there is still a way to find that which is free from grieving, aging, and illness: the deathless.

              & any other evil doers,
              would, through water ablution,
              be from evil kamma set free.
            
            
              If these rivers could carry off
              the evil kamma you’ve done in the past,
              they’d carry off your merit as well,
              and then you’d be
              completely deprived.
              Whatever it is that you fear,
              that you’re always going down to the water,
              don’t do it.
              Don’t let the cold hurt your skin.”
            
            
              The Brahman:
              I’ve been following the miserable path, good lady,
              and now you’ve brought me
              back to the noble.
              I give you this robe for water-ablution.
            
            
              Puṇṇikā:
              Let the robe be yours. I don’t need it.
              If you’re afraid of pain,
              if you dislike pain,
              then don’t do any evil kamma,
              in open, in secret.
              But if you do or will do
              any evil kamma,
              you’ll gain no freedom from pain,
              even if you fly up & hurry away.
              If you’re afraid of pain,
              if you dislike pain,
              go to the Awakened One for refuge,
              go to the Dhamma & Saṅgha.
              Take on the precepts:
              That will lead to your liberation.2
            
            
              The Brahman:
              I go to the Awakened One for refuge;
              I go to the Dhamma & Saṅgha.

            Rohiṇī’s father:
            You go to sleep saying,
            “Contemplatives.”
            You wake up,
            “Contemplatives.”
            You praise only
            contemplatives.
            No doubt you will be
            a contemplative.
            
              Abundant food & drink
              you give to contemplatives.
              Now, Rohiṇī, I ask you:
              Why do you hold
              contemplatives dear?

              full of hankerings,

              For a long time, father,
              you’ve quizzed me
              about contemplatives.
              I’ll praise to you

              discernment,
              virtue,
              endeavor.
            
            
              They do like to work,
              they’re not lazy.
              They do the best work:
              They abandon
              passion & anger.
              That’s why I hold
              contemplatives dear.

              nor money.
              They live off whatever is present:
              That’s why I hold

              Rohiṇī, truly for our benefit
              were you born in our family.
              You have conviction

              You truly discern
              this field of merit
              unexcelled.
              These contemplatives will receive
              our offering, too,

            “I was a child, with clean clothes,
            when I first heard the Dhamma.
            And within me, heedful,
            was a break-through to the truth.
            Then I arrived
            at an enormous dissatisfaction
            with all sensuality.
            Seeing the danger
            in self-identity,
            I longed only

              in the well-taught true Dhamma,

              aspiring to nothingness—

              to take them back.

              This [gold] isn’t proper for contemplatives.
              This isn’t noble wealth.
              This is
              greediness, intoxication,
              delusion, bondage to dust,
              suspicion, many troubles.
              There’s no lasting stability here.
              It’s to this extent that many, many men
              —heedless, their hearts defiled—
              opposing one another, create
              conflicts, murder, bondage,
              calamity, loss, grief, & lamentation.
              Many misfortunes are seen
              for those head-over-heels in sensuality.
              So, my relatives:
              Why do you, like enemies,
              try to bind me to sensuality?
              You know I’ve gone forth,
              seeing the danger in sensuality.
              Gold coin & bullion
              can’t put an end to effluents.
              Sensuality is an enemy,
              a murderer,
              hostile, arrows & bonds.
              So, my relatives:
              Why do you, like enemies,
              try to bind me to sensuality?
              You know I’ve gone forth
              with shaven head, wrapped in a patchwork cloak.
              Leftover alms-scraps, gleanings,
              a robe made from cast-off cloth:
              That’s what’s proper for me—
              the requisites of one with no home.
              The great seers have rejected sensuality,
              both human & divine.
              Released are they,
              in the place of security.
              Arrived are they,
              in unshaken ease.
            
            
              So may I not come into union
              with sensuality, in which no shelter is found.
              It’s an enemy, a murderer
              —sensuality—
              painful, like a mass of flame.
              Greed:
              an obstacle,1 fearful, threatened,
              full of thorns,
              very discordant,
              a great cause of delusion.
              Sensuality:
              a frightening attack,
              like a snake’s head
              in which fools delight—
              blinded, run-of-the-mill.
            
            
              Because many people in the world
              are stuck in the mud of sensuality,
              unknowing,
              they don’t realize the ending of birth & death.
              Many people follow the path
              to bad destinations
              because of sensuality,
              bringing disease on themselves.
            
            
              Thus sensuality creates enemies.
              It burns, is defiled.
              It’s the bait of the world,
              constraining, the bondage of death,
              maddening, deceptive, agitating the mind.
              It’s a net cast by Māra
              for the defilement of living beings:
              with endless drawbacks, much pain,
              great poison,
              giving little enjoyment, creating conflict,
              drying up the good side [of the mind].
            
            
              I, having cast off2 much trouble like this
              caused by sensuality,
              will not return to it,
              as I always delight in unbinding.
              Doing battle with sensuality
              in hopes of the cool state,
              I will stay heedful, finding delight3
              in the ending of fetters.
              I follow the path—
              eightfold, straight,
              griefless, stainless, secure—
              over which great seers
              have crossed.”

          As Subhā the nun was going through Jīvaka’s delightful mango grove, a libertine (a goldsmith’s son) blocked her path, so she said to him:
          
            ‘What wrong have I done you
            that you stand in my way?
            It’s not proper, my friend,
            that a man should touch
            a woman gone forth.
            I respect the Master’s message,
            the training pointed out by the One Well-Gone.
            I am pure, without blemish:
            Why do you stand in my way?
            You—your mind agitated, impassioned;
            I—unagitated, unimpassioned,
            with a mind entirely freed:
            Why do you stand in my way?’
            
              ‘You are young & not bad-looking,
              what need do you have for going forth?
              Throw off your ochre robe—
              Come, let’s delight in the flowering grove.
              A sweetness they exude everywhere,
              the trees risen-up with their pollen.
              The beginning of spring is a pleasant season—
              Come, let’s delight in the flowering grove.
              The trees with their blossoming tips
              moan, as it were, in the breeze:
              What delight will you have
              if you plunge into the grove alone?
              Frequented by herds of wild beasts,
              disturbed by elephants rutting & aroused:
              You want to go
              unaccompanied
              into the great, lonely, frightening grove?
            
            
              Like a doll made of gold, you will go about,
              like a goddess in the gardens of heaven.
              With delicate, smooth Kāsī fabrics,
              you will shine, O beauty without compare.
              I would gladly do your every bidding
              if we were to dwell in the glade.
              For there is no creature dearer to me
              than you, O nymph with the languid regard.
              If you do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.
              Dwelling in the calm of a palace,
              have women wait on you,
              wear delicate Kāsī fabrics,
              adorn yourself with garlands & creams.
              I will make you many & varied ornaments
              of gold, jewels, & pearls.
              Climb onto a costly bed,
              scented with sandalwood carvings,
              with a well-washed coverlet, beautiful,
              spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.
            
            
              Like a blue lotus rising from the water
              where no human beings dwell,
              you will go to old age with your limbs unseen,
              if you stay as you are in the holy life.’
            
            
              ‘What do you assume of any essence,
              here in this cemetery grower, filled with corpses,
              this body destined to break up?
              What do you see when you look at me,
              you who are out of your mind?’
            
            
              ‘Your eyes are like those of a fawn,
              like those of a sprite in the mountains.
              Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight
              grows all the more.
              Like tips they are, of blue lotuses,
              in your golden face
              —spotless:
              Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight
              grows all the more.
              Even if you should go far away,
              I will think only of your pure,
              long-lashed gaze,
              for there is nothing dearer to me
              than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.’
            
            
              ‘You want to stray from the road,
              you want the moon as a plaything,
              you want to jump over Mount Sineru,
              you who have designs on one born of the Buddha.
              For there is nothing anywhere at all
              in the cosmos with its devas,
              that would be an object of passion for me.
              I don’t even know what that passion would be,
              for it’s been killed, root & all, by the path.
              Like embers from a pit—scattered,
              like a bowl of poison—evaporated,
              I don’t even see what that passion would be,
              for it’s been killed, root & all, by the path.
              Try to seduce one who hasn’t reflected on this,
              or who has not followed the Master’s teaching.
              But try it with this one who knows
              and you suffer.
              For in the midst of praise & blame,
              pleasure & pain,
              my mindfulness stands firm.
              Knowing the unattractiveness
              of things compounded,
              my mind cleaves to nothing at all.
              I am a follower of the One Well-Gone,
              riding the vehicle of the eightfold way:
              My arrow removed, effluent-free,
              I delight, having gone to an empty dwelling.
              For I have seen well-painted puppets,
              hitched up with sticks & strings,
              made to dance in various ways.
              When the sticks & strings are removed,
              thrown away, scattered, shredded,
              smashed into pieces, not to be found,
              in what will the mind there make its home?
              This body of mine, which is just like that,
              when devoid of dhammas doesn’t function.
              When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn’t function,
              in what will the mind there make its home?
            
            
              Like a mural you’ve seen, painted on a wall,
              smeared with yellow orpiment,
              there your vision has been distorted,
              your perception1 of a human being—pointless.
              Like an evaporated mirage,
              like a tree of gold in a dream,
              like a magic show in the midst of a crowd—
              you run blind after what is unreal.
              Resembling a ball of sealing wax,
              set in a hollow,
              with a bubble in the middle
              and bathed with tears,
              eye secretions are born there too:
              The parts of the eye
              are rolled all together
              in various ways.’
            
            
              Plucking out her lovely eye,
              with mind unattached
              she felt no regret.
            
            
              ‘Here, take this eye. It’s yours.’
            
            
              Straightaway she gave it to him.
              Straightaway his passion faded right there,
              and he begged her forgiveness:
            
            
              ‘Be well, follower of the holy life.
              This sort of thing
              won’t happen again.
              Harming a person like you
              is like embracing a blazing fire.
              It’s as if I have seized a poisonous snake.
              So may you be well. Forgive me.’
            
            
              And released from there, the nun
              went to the excellent Buddha’s presence.
              When she saw the mark of his excellent merit,
              her eye became
              as it was before.",No Introduction,"1. Reading saññā with the Burmese and Sinhalese editions. The Thai and PTS editions read paññā, “discernment.”",: SN 5:5; AN 4:184; AN 5:75–76; Thag 16:1
