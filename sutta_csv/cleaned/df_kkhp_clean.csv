              “There are beings with multiplicity of body and multiplicity of perception, such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms. This is the first station of consciousness.  
              “There are beings with multiplicity of body and singularity of perception, such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first (jhāna). This is the second station of consciousness.

            I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she addressed him with a verse.
            
            “Many devas & human beings
            give thought to protection,
            desiring well-being.
            Tell, then, the highest protection.”
            
              The Buddha:
              “Not consorting with fools,
              consorting with the wise,
              paying homage to those worthy of homage:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Living in a civilized land,
              having made merit in the past,
              directing oneself rightly:1
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Broad knowledge, skill,
              well-mastered discipline,
              well-spoken words:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Support for one’s mother & father,2
              assistance to one’s wife and children,
              consistency in one’s work:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Generosity, living in rectitude,
              assistance to one’s relatives,
              deeds that are blameless:
              This is the highest protection.

              refraining from intoxicants,
              being heedful of the mental qualities
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Respect, humility,
              contentment, gratitude,
              hearing the Dhamma on timely occasions:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Patience, composure,
              seeing contemplatives,
              discussing the Dhamma on timely occasions:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Austerity, celibacy,
              seeing the noble truths,
              realizing unbinding:

              identity-views, uncertainty,
              & any attachment to habits & practices.4
              One is completely released

              and incapable of committing
              the six great wrongs.6

              Whatever bad deed one may do
              —in body, speech, or in mind—
              one cannot hide it:
              an incapability ascribed
              to one who has seen the Way.

              foremost-bringing,
              unsurpassed, he taught the

              Ended the old, there is no new taking birth.
              Dispassioned their minds toward future becoming,
              they,
              with no seed,
              no desire for growth,
              the enlightened,    go out like this flame.7

According to SnA, the six great wrongs are: murdering one’s mother, murdering one’s father, murdering an arahant (fully awakened individual), wounding a Buddha, causing a schism in the Saṅgha, or choosing anyone other than a Buddha as one’s foremost teacher. The first five are listed in AN 5:129 as leading immediately to hell after death.

            This passage is identical with Pv 1:5.
            
            Outside the walls they stand,
            & at crossroads.
            At doorposts they stand,
            returning to their old homes.
            But when a meal with plentiful food & drink is served,
            no one remembers them:
            Such is the kamma of living beings.
            
              So those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives
              give timely donations of proper food & drink
              —exquisite, clean—
              [thinking:]
              “May this be for our relatives.
              May our relatives be happy!”
            
            
              And those who have gathered there,
              the assembled shades of the relatives,
              with appreciation, give their blessing
              for the plentiful food & drink:
              “May our relatives live long
              because of whom we have gained [this gift].
              We have been honored,
              and the donors are not without reward!”
            
            
              For there [in their realm] there’s
              no farming,
              no herding of cattle,
              no commerce,
              no trading with money.
              They live on what is given here,
              hungry ghosts
              whose time here is done.
            
            
              As water raining on a hill
              flows down to the valley,
              even so does what is given here
              benefit the dead.1
              As rivers full of water
              fill the ocean full,
              even so does what is given here
              benefit the dead.
            
            
              “He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,
              they were my relatives, companions, friends”:
              Offerings should be given for the dead
              when one reflects thus
              on things done in the past.
              For
              no weeping,
              no sorrowing
              no other lamentation
              benefits the dead
              whose relatives persist in that way.
              But when this offering is given,
              well-placed in the Saṅgha,
              it works for their long-term benefit
              and they profit immediately.
            
            
              In this way
              the proper duty to relatives has been shown,
              great honor has been done to the dead,
              and monks have been given strength:
            
            
              The merit you’ve acquired
              isn’t small.2

            A person stashes a fund away
            deep underground, at the water line:
            “When a need or duty arises,
            this will provide for my needs,
            for my release if I’m denounced by the king,
            molested by thieves,
            in case of debt, famine, or accidents.”
            With aims like this
            in the world
            a reserve fund is stashed away.
            
              But no matter how well it’s stored,
              deep underground, at the water line,
              it won’t all always serve one’s need.
              The fund gets shifted from its place,
              or one’s memory gets confused;
              or—unseen—
              nāgas make off with it,
              spirits steal it,
              or hateful heirs run off with it.
              When one’s merit’s ended,
              it’s totally destroyed.
            
            
              But when a man or woman
              has laid aside a well-stored fund
              of generosity, virtue,
              restraint, & self-control,
              with regard to a shrine,
              the Saṅgha,
              a fine individual,
              guests,
              mother, father,
              or elder sibling:
              That’s a well-stored fund.
              It can’t be wrested away.
              It follows you along.
              When, having left this world,
              for wherever you must go,
              you take it with you.
              This fund is not held in common with others,
              & cannot be stolen by thieves.
            
            
              So, enlightened, you should make merit,
              the fund that will follow you along.
              This is the fund
              that gives all they want
              to beings human, divine.
            
            
              Whatever devas aspire to,

              That is all gained by this.
              Earthly kingship, supremacy,
              the bliss of an emperor,
              kingship over devas in the heavens:
              That is all gained by this.
              The attainment of the human state,

              1. Proper practice of the Dhamma.
              2. Clear knowing (vijjā) = knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of the passing away and arising (rebirth) of beings, knowledge of the ending of the [mental] effluents: sensual passion, becoming, and ignorance.  Release (vimutti) = release from the cycle of rebirth.
              3. Acumen (paṭisambhidā) = acumen with regard to the Dhamma, to its meaning, to language, & to quick-wittedness. These four talents are found in some, but not all, arahants.
              4. Vimokkha. DN 15 describes the eight emancipations as follows:
              
                “Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is the first emancipation.
                “Not percipient of form internally, one sees forms externally. This is the second emancipation.
                “One is intent only on the beautiful. This is the third emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of multiplicity, [perceiving,] ‘Infinite space,’ one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving,] ‘Infinite consciousness,’ one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [perceiving,] ‘There is nothing,’ one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, one enters and remains in the cessation of perception & feeling. This is the eighth emancipation.
                “Now, when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order, in reverse order, in forward and reverse order, when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants, however he wants, and for as long as he wants, when through the ending of the [mental] effluents he enters & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing them for himself right in the here-&-now, he is said to be a monk released in both ways. And as for another release in both ways, higher or more sublime than this, there is none.”

              or despise anyone anywhere,
              or through anger or resistance-perception

              1. The image here is sometimes misconstrued as saying that one should protect all beings as a mother would protect her only child. Actually, the parallel is not between the child and all living beings; it is between the child and one’s cultivation of the heart: One should protect one’s goodwill toward all beings in the same way that a mother would protect her only child. On this point, see MN 21.
