              “There are beings with multiplicity of body and multiplicity of perception, such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms. This is the first station of consciousness.  
              “There are beings with multiplicity of body and singularity of perception, such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first (jhāna). This is the second station of consciousness.

            I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she addressed him with a verse.
            
            “Many devas & human beings
            give thought to protection,
            desiring well-being.
            Tell, then, the highest protection.”
            
              The Buddha:
              “Not consorting with fools,
              consorting with the wise,
              paying homage to those worthy of homage:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Living in a civilized land,
              having made merit in the past,
              directing oneself rightly:1
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Broad knowledge, skill,
              well-mastered discipline,
              well-spoken words:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Support for one’s mother & father,2
              assistance to one’s wife and children,
              consistency in one’s work:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Generosity, living in rectitude,
              assistance to one’s relatives,
              deeds that are blameless:
              This is the highest protection.

              refraining from intoxicants,
              being heedful of the mental qualities
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Respect, humility,
              contentment, gratitude,
              hearing the Dhamma on timely occasions:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Patience, composure,
              seeing contemplatives,
              discussing the Dhamma on timely occasions:
              This is the highest protection.
            
            
              Austerity, celibacy,
              seeing the noble truths,
              realizing unbinding:

              identity-views, uncertainty,
              & any attachment to habits & practices.4
              One is completely released

              and incapable of committing
              the six great wrongs.6

              Whatever bad deed one may do
              —in body, speech, or in mind—
              one cannot hide it:
              an incapability ascribed
              to one who has seen the Way.

              foremost-bringing,
              unsurpassed, he taught the

              Ended the old, there is no new taking birth.
              Dispassioned their minds toward future becoming,
              they,
              with no seed,
              no desire for growth,
              the enlightened,    go out like this flame.7

According to SnA, the six great wrongs are: murdering one’s mother, murdering one’s father, murdering an arahant (fully awakened individual), wounding a Buddha, causing a schism in the Saṅgha, or choosing anyone other than a Buddha as one’s foremost teacher. The first five are listed in AN 5:129 as leading immediately to hell after death.

            This passage is identical with Pv 1:5.
            
            Outside the walls they stand,
            & at crossroads.
            At doorposts they stand,
            returning to their old homes.
            But when a meal with plentiful food & drink is served,
            no one remembers them:
            Such is the kamma of living beings.
            
              So those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives
              give timely donations of proper food & drink
              —exquisite, clean—
              [thinking:]
              “May this be for our relatives.
              May our relatives be happy!”
            
            
              And those who have gathered there,
              the assembled shades of the relatives,
              with appreciation, give their blessing
              for the plentiful food & drink:
              “May our relatives live long
              because of whom we have gained [this gift].
              We have been honored,
              and the donors are not without reward!”
            
            
              For there [in their realm] there’s
              no farming,
              no herding of cattle,
              no commerce,
              no trading with money.
              They live on what is given here,
              hungry ghosts
              whose time here is done.
            
            
              As water raining on a hill
              flows down to the valley,
              even so does what is given here
              benefit the dead.1
              As rivers full of water
              fill the ocean full,
              even so does what is given here
              benefit the dead.
            
            
              “He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,
              they were my relatives, companions, friends”:
              Offerings should be given for the dead
              when one reflects thus
              on things done in the past.
              For
              no weeping,
              no sorrowing
              no other lamentation
              benefits the dead
              whose relatives persist in that way.
              But when this offering is given,
              well-placed in the Saṅgha,
              it works for their long-term benefit
              and they profit immediately.
            
            
              In this way
              the proper duty to relatives has been shown,
              great honor has been done to the dead,
              and monks have been given strength:
            
            
              The merit you’ve acquired
              isn’t small.2

            A person stashes a fund away
            deep underground, at the water line:
            “When a need or duty arises,
            this will provide for my needs,
            for my release if I’m denounced by the king,
            molested by thieves,

            With aims like this
            in the world
            a reserve fund is stashed away.
            
              But no matter how well it’s stored,
              deep underground, at the water line,
              it won’t all always serve one’s need.
              The fund gets shifted from its place,
              or one’s memory gets confused;
              or—unseen—
              nāgas make off with it,
              spirits steal it,
              or hateful heirs run off with it.
              When one’s merit’s ended,
              it’s totally destroyed.
            
            
              But when a man or woman
              has laid aside a well-stored fund

              or elder sibling:
              That’s a well-stored fund.
              It can’t be wrested away.
              It follows you along.
              When, having left this world,
              for wherever you must go,
              you take it with you.
              This fund is not held in common with others,
              & cannot be stolen by thieves.

              1. Proper practice of the Dhamma.
              2. Clear knowing (vijjā) = knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of the passing away and arising (rebirth) of beings, knowledge of the ending of the [mental] effluents: sensual passion, becoming, and ignorance.  Release (vimutti) = release from the cycle of rebirth.
              3. Acumen (paṭisambhidā) = acumen with regard to the Dhamma, to its meaning, to language, & to quick-wittedness. These four talents are found in some, but not all, arahants.
              4. Vimokkha. DN 15 describes the eight emancipations as follows:
              
                “Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is the first emancipation.
                “Not percipient of form internally, one sees forms externally. This is the second emancipation.
                “One is intent only on the beautiful. This is the third emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of multiplicity, [perceiving,] ‘Infinite space,’ one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving,] ‘Infinite consciousness,’ one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [perceiving,] ‘There is nothing,’ one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh emancipation.
                “With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, one enters and remains in the cessation of perception & feeling. This is the eighth emancipation.
                “Now, when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order, in reverse order, in forward and reverse order, when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants, however he wants, and for as long as he wants, when through the ending of the [mental] effluents he enters & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing them for himself right in the here-&-now, he is said to be a monk released in both ways. And as for another release in both ways, higher or more sublime than this, there is none.”

              1. The image here is sometimes misconstrued as saying that one should protect all beings as a mother would protect her only child. Actually, the parallel is not between the child and all living beings; it is between the child and one’s cultivation of the heart: One should protect one’s goodwill toward all beings in the same way that a mother would protect her only child. On this point, see MN 21.

                a well-spoken word
                is fruitful

                one born & mortal
                should do
                –with what’s born & is mortal–
                many a skillful thing.

                jasmine,
                tagara.
                But the scent of the good
                does go against the wind.
                The person of integrity
                wafts a scent
                in every direction.
              
              
                Sandalwood, tagara,
                lotus, & jasmine:
                among these scents,
                the scent of virtue
                is unsurpassed.
              
              
                Next to nothing, this scent
                –sandalwood, tagara–
                while the scent of virtuous conduct
                wafts to the devas,
                supreme.

                unaware of True Dhamma,
                samsara

                then continue your course,

                ‘I have sons, I have wealth’–
                the fool torments himself.
                When even he himself
                doesn’t belong to himself,
                how then sons?
                How wealth?
              
              62
              
                A fool with a sense of his foolishness
                is–at least to that extent–wise.
                But a fool who thinks himself wise
                really deserves to be called
                a fool.
              
              63
              
                Even if for a lifetime
                the fool stays with the wise,
                he knows nothing of the Dhamma–
                as the ladle,
                the taste of the soup.
              
              
                Even if for a moment,
                the perceptive person stays with the wise,
                he immediately knows the Dhamma–
                as the tongue,
                the taste of the soup.
              
              64-65
              
                Fools, their wisdom weak,
                are their own enemies
                as they go through life,
                doing evil
                that bears
                bitter fruit.

                It’s not good,
                the doing of the deed
                that,   once it’s done,
                you regret,
                whose result you reap crying,
                your face in tears.
              
              
                It’s good,

              67-68
              
                As long as evil has yet to ripen,
                the fool mistakes it for honey.
                But when that evil ripens,
                the fool falls into
                pain.

                Month after month
                the fool might eat
                only a tip-of-grass measure of food,
                but he wouldn’t be worth
                one sixteenth
                of those who’ve fathomed
                the Dhamma.

                An evil deed, when done,

                come out right away.
                It follows the fool,
                smoldering
                like a fire
                hidden in ashes.

                Only for his ruin
                does renown come to the fool.
                It ravages his bright fortune
                & rips his head      apart.
              
              
                He would want unwarranted status,
                preeminence among monks,
                authority
                among monasteries,
                homage
                from lay families.
              
              
                ‘Let householders & those gone forth
                both think that this
                was done by me alone.
                May I alone determine
                what’s a duty, what’s not’:
                the resolve of a fool
                as they grow–
                his desire & pride.

                goes one way,
                the way to Unbinding,
                another.
                Realizing this, the monk,
                a disciple to the Awakened One,
                should not relish offerings,
                should cultivate            seclusion
                instead.

                If you hold yourself dear
                then guard, guard yourself well.
                The wise person would stay awake
                nursing himself
                in any of the three watches of the night,
                the three stages of life.

                First
                he’d settle himself
                in what is correct,
                only then
                teach others.
                He wouldn’t stain his name
                : he is wise.
              
              158
              
                If you’d mold yourself
                the way you teach others,
                then, well-trained,
                go ahead & tame–
                for, as they say,
                what’s hard to tame is you
                yourself.
              
              159

                your own mainstay,
                for who else could your mainstay be?
                With you yourself well-trained
                you obtain the mainstay
                hard to obtain.

                as a diamond, a precious stone.

                you do to yourself
                what an enemy would wish.

                things of no good
                & no use to yourself.
                What’s truly useful & good
                is truly harder than hard to do.

                whoever maligns it
                –a dullard,
                inspired by evil view–
                bears fruit for his own destruction,
                like the fruiting of the bamboo.
              
              164*
              
                Evil is done
                by oneself,
                by oneself is one defiled.
                Evil is left undone
                by oneself,
                by oneself is one cleansed.
                Purity & impurity are one’s own doing.
                No one purifies another.
                No other purifies one.

                for that of another,
                no matter how great.

                moderation
                in food,
                dwelling in                  seclusion,
                commitment to the heightened mind:
                this is the teaching
                of the Awakened.
              
              183-185*
              
                Not even if it rained gold coins
                would we have our fill
                of sensual pleasures.
                ‘Stressful,
                they give little enjoyment’–
                knowing this, the wise one
                finds no delight
                even in heavenly sensual pleasures.
              
              
                He is
                one who delights
                in the ending of craving,
                a disciple of the Rightly
                Self-Awakened One.
              
              186-187
              
                They go to many a refuge,
                to mountains & forests,
                to park & tree shrines:
                people threatened with danger.
                That’s not the secure refuge,
                not the supreme refuge,
                that’s not the refuge,
                having gone to which,
                you gain release
                from all suffering & stress.
                But when, having gone
                to the Buddha, Dhamma,
                & Sangha for refuge,
                you see with right discernment
                the four noble truths–
                stress,
                the cause of stress,
                the transcending of stress,
                & the noble eightfold path,
                the way to the stilling of stress:
                that’s the secure refuge,
                that, the supreme refuge,
                that is the refuge,
                having gone to which,
                you gain release
                from all suffering & stress.

                It’s hard to come by
                a thoroughbred of a man.
                It’s simply not true
                that he’s born everywhere.
                Wherever he’s born, an enlightened one,
                the family prospers,
                is happy.
              
              193
              
                A blessing:      the arising of Awakened Ones.
                A blessing:      the teaching of true Dhamma.
                A blessing:      the concord of the Sangha.
                The austerity of those in concord
                is a blessing.
              
              194
              
                If you worship those worthy of worship,
                –Awakened Ones or their disciples–
                who’ve transcended
                objectification,
                crossed over
                lamentation
                & grief,
                who are unendangered,
                fearless,
                unbound:
                there’s no measure for reckoning
                that your merit’s ‘this much.’

                You are now
                like a yellowed leaf.
                Already
                Yama’s minions stand near.
                You stand at the door to departure
                but have yet to provide
                for the journey.

                Work quickly! Be wise!
                With impurities all blown away,
                unblemished,
                you’ll reach the divine realm
                of the noble ones.
              
              
                You are now
                right at the end of your time.
                You are headed
                to Yama’s presence,
                with no place to rest along the way,

                No initiative: of a household.
                Indolence: of beauty.

                In a woman, misconduct is an impurity.
                In a donor, stinginess.
                Evil deeds are the real impurities
                in this world & the next.
              
              
                More impure than these impurities
                is the ultimate impurity:
                ignorance.
                Having abandoned this impurity,
                monks, you’re impurity-free.

                corrupt, back-biting,
                forward, & brash;
                but for someone who’s constantly
                scrupulous, cautious,
                observant, sincere,
                pure in his livelihood,

                it’s hard.

                Whoever kills, lies, steals,
                goes to someone else’s wife,
                & is addicted to intoxicants,
                digs himself up
                by the root
                right here in this world.
              
              
                So know, my good man,
                that bad deeds are reckless.
                Don’t let greed & unrighteousness
                oppress you with long-term pain.

                at food & drink given to others,

                It’s easy to see
                the errors of others,
                but hard to see
                your own.
                You winnow like chaff
                the errors of others,
                but conceal your own–
                like a cheat, an unlucky throw.
              
              
                If you focus on the errors of others,
                constantly finding fault,
                your effluents flourish.
                You’re far from their ending.

                People are smitten
                with objectification,

                Advanced in years,

                The liar observing no duties,
                filled with greed & desire:

                As long as one follows

                one is no monk at all.

                That drunk-on-his-sons-&-cattle man,

                death sweeps him away–
                as a great flood,
                a village asleep.
              
              
                There are

                no family
                for one seized by the Ender,
                no shelter among kin.

                this force of reasoning,
                the wise man, restrained by virtue,
                should make the path pure
                –right away–

                deep in rut, is hard to control.
                Bound, he won’t eat a morsel:
                the tusker misses
                the elephant wood.
              
              324*
              
                When torpid & over-fed,
                a sleepy-head lolling about
                like a stout hog, fattened on fodder:
                a dullard enters the womb
                over &
                over again.
              
              325
              
                Before, this mind went wandering
                however it pleased,
                wherever it wanted,
                by whatever way that it liked.
                Today I will hold it aptly in check–
                as one wielding a goad, an elephant in rut.
              
              326
              
                Delight in heedfulness.
                Watch over your own mind.
                Lift yourself up
                from the hard-going way,
                like a tusker sunk in the mud.
              
              327
              
                If you gain a mature companion–
                a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened–
                overcoming all dangers
                go with him, gratified,
                mindful.
              
              
                If you don’t gain a mature companion–
                a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened–
                go alone
                like a king renouncing his kingdom,
                like the elephant in the Matanga wilds,
                his herd.
              
              
                Going alone is better.
                There’s no companionship with a fool.
                Go alone,
                doing no evil, at peace,
                like the elephant in the Matanga wilds.
              
              328-330*
              
                A blessing:   friends when the need arises.
                A blessing:   contentment with whatever there is.
                Merit at the ending of life is a blessing.
                A blessing:   the abandoning of all suffering
                & stress.
              
              
                A blessing in the world:   reverence to your mother.
                A blessing:   reverence to your father as well.
                A blessing in the world:   reverence to a contemplative.
                A blessing:   reverence for a brahman, too.
              
              
                A blessing into old age is virtue.
                A blessing:   conviction established.
                A blessing:   discernment attained.
                The non-doing of evil things is
                a blessing.

                When a person lives heedlessly,
                his craving grows like a creeping vine.
                He runs now here
                & now         there,
                as if looking for fruit:
                a monkey in the forest.
              
              334
              
                If this sticky, uncouth craving
                overcomes you in the world,
                your sorrows grow like wild grass
                after rain.
              
              
                If, in the world, you overcome
                this uncouth craving, hard to escape,
                sorrows roll off you,
                like water beads off
                a lotus.
              
              335-336
              
                To all of you gathered here
                I say: Good fortune.
                Dig up craving
                –as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass–
                by the root.
                Don’t let Mara cut you down
                –as a raging river, a reed–
                over & over again.
              
              337*
              
                If its root remains
                undamaged & strong,
                a tree, even if cut,
                will grow back.
                So too if craving-obsession
                is not rooted out,
                this suffering returns
                again
                &
                again.
              
              338
              
                He whose 36 streams,
                flowing to what is appealing, are strong:
                the currents–resolves based on passion–
                carry him, of base views, away.
              
              
                They flow every which way, the streams,
                but the sprouted creeper stays
                in place.
                Now, seeing that the creeper’s arisen,
                cut through its root
                with discernment.
              
              339-340*
              
                Loosened & oiled
                are the joys of a person.
                People, bound by enticement,
                looking for ease:
                to birth & aging they go.
              
              341*
              
                Encircled with craving,
                people hop round & around
                like a rabbit caught in a snare.
                Tied with fetters & bonds
                they go on to suffering,
                again & again, for long.
              
              
                Encircled with craving,
                people hop round & around
                like a rabbit caught in a snare.
                So a monk
                should dispel      craving,
                should aspire      to dispassion
                for himself.
              
              342-343*
              
                Cleared of the underbrush
                but obsessed with the forest,
                set free from the forest,
                right back to the forest he runs.
                Come, see the person set free
                who runs right back to the same old chains!
              
              344
              
                That’s not a strong bond
                –so say the enlightened–
                the one made of iron, of wood, or of grass.
                To be smitten, enthralled,
                with jewels & ornaments,
                longing for children & wives:
                that’s the strong bond,
                –so say the enlightened–
                one that’s constraining,
                elastic,
                hard to untie.
              
              
                But having cut it, they
                –the enlightened–go forth,
                free of longing, abandoning
                sensual ease.
              
              
                Those smitten with passion
                fall back
                into a self-made stream,
                like a spider snared in its web.
                But, having cut it, the enlightened set forth,
                free of longing, abandoning
                all suffering & stress.
              
              345-347*
              
                Gone to the beyond of becoming,
                you let go of in front,
                let go of behind,
                let go of between.
                With a heart everywhere released,
                you don’t come again to birth
                & aging.
              
              348*
              
                For a person
                forced on by his thinking,
                fierce in his passion,
                focused on beauty,
                craving grows all the more.
                He’s the one
                who tightens the bond.
              
              
                But one who delights
                in the stilling of thinking,
                always
                mindful
                cultivating
                a focus on the foul:
                He’s the one
                who will make an end,
                the one who will cut Mara’s bond.
              
              349-350*
              
                Arrived at the finish,
                unfrightened, unblemished, free
                of craving, he has cut away
                the arrows of becoming.
                This physical heap is his last.
              
              
                Free from craving,
                ungrasping,
                astute in expression,
                knowing the combination of sounds–
                which comes first & which after.
                He’s called a
                last-body
                greatly discerning
                great man.
              
              351-352*
              
                All-conquering,
                all-knowing am I,
                with regard to all things,
                unadhering.
                All-abandoning,
                released in the ending of craving:
                having fully known on my own,
                to whom should I point as my teacher?
              
              353*
              
                A gift of Dhamma conquers
                all gifts;
                the taste of Dhamma,
                all tastes;
                a delight in Dhamma,
                all delights;
                the ending of craving,
                all suffering
                & stress.
              
              354*
              
                Riches ruin the man
                weak in discernment,
                but not those who seek
                the beyond.
                Through craving for riches
                the man weak in discernment
                ruins   himself
                as he would   others.

                a monk.
              
              367
              
                Dwelling in goodwill, a monk
                with faith in the Awakened One’s teaching,
                would attain the good state,
                the peaceful state:
                stilling-of-fabrications ease.
              
              368*
              
                Monk, bail out this boat.
                It will take you lightly when bailed.
                Having cut through passion, aversion,
                you go from there to Unbinding.
              
              369*
              
                Cut through five,
                let go of five,
                & develop five above all.
                A monk gone past five attachments
                is said to have crossed the flood.
              
              370*
              
                Practice jhana, monk,
                and don’t be heedless.
                Don’t take your mind roaming
                in sensual strands.
                Don’t swallow–heedless–
                the ball of iron aflame.
                Don’t burn & complain: ‘This is pain.’
              
              371
              
                There’s
                no jhana
                for one with
                no discernment,
                no discernment
                for one with
                no jhana.
                But one with
                both jhana
                & discernment:
                he’s on the verge
                of Unbinding.
              
              372
              
                A monk with his mind at peace,
                going into an empty dwelling,
                clearly seeing the Dhamma aright:
                his delight is more
                than human.
              
              
                However it is,
                however it is he touches
                the arising-&-passing of aggregates:
                he gains rapture & joy:
                that, for those who know it,
                is deathless,
                the Deathless.
              
              373-374
              
                Here the first things
                for a discerning monk
                are
                guarding the senses,
                contentment,
                restraint in line with the Patimokkha.
                He should associate with admirable friends.
              
              
                Living purely, untiring,
                hospitable by habit,
                skilled in his conduct,
                gaining a manifold joy,
                he will put an end
                to suffering & stress.
              
              375-376
              
                Shed passion
                & aversion, monks–
                as a jasmine would,
                its withered flowers.
              
              377
              
                Calmed in body,
                calmed in speech,
                well-centered & calm,
                having disgorged the baits of the world,
                a monk is called
                thoroughly
                calmed.
              
              378
              
                You yourself
                should reprove yourself,
                should examine yourself.
                As a self-guarded monk
                with guarded self,
                mindful, you dwell at ease.
              
              379
              
                Your own self is
                your own mainstay.
                Your own self is
                your own guide.
                Therefore you should
                watch over yourself–
                as a trader, a fine steed.
              
              380
              
                A monk with a manifold joy,
                with faith in the Awakened One’s teaching,

                the peaceful state:

              381*
              
                A young monk who strives
                in the Awakened One’s teaching,
                brightens the world
                like the moon set free from a cloud.

                Having striven, brahman,
                cut the stream.
                Expel sensual passions.
                Knowing the ending of fabrications,
                brahman,
                you know the Unmade.
              
              383*
              
                When the brahman has gone
                to the beyond of two things,
                then all his fetters
                go to their end–
                he who knows.
              
              384*
              
                One whose beyond or
                not-beyond or
                beyond-&-not-beyond
                can’t be found;
                unshackled, carefree:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              385*
              
                Sitting silent, dustless,
                absorbed in jhana,
                his task done, effluents gone,
                ultimate goal attained:
                he’s what I call

                By day shines the sun;
                by night, the moon;
                in armor, the warrior;
                in jhana, the brahman.
                But all day & all night,
                every day & every night,
                the Awakened One shines

                He’s called a brahman	
                for having banished his evil,
                a contemplative
                for living in consonance,
                one gone forth
                for having forsaken
                his own impurities.
              
              388*
              
                One should not strike a brahman,
                nor should the brahman
                let loose with his anger.
                Shame on a brahman’s killer.
                More shame on the brahman
                whose anger’s let loose.
              
              389*
              
                Nothing’s better for the brahman
                than when the mind is held back
                from what is endearing & not.
                However his harmful-heartedness
                wears away,
                that’s how stress
                simply comes to rest.
              
              390*
              
                Whoever does no wrong
                in body,
                speech,
                heart,
                is restrained in these three ways:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              391
              
                The person from whom
                you would learn the Dhamma
                taught by the Rightly
                Self-Awakened One:
                you should honor him with respect–
                as a brahman, the flame for a sacrifice.
              
              392*
              
                Not by matted hair,
                by clan, or by birth,
                is one a brahman.
                Whoever has truth
                & rectitude:
                he is a pure one,
                he, a brahman.
              
              
                What’s the use of your matted hair,
                you dullard?
                What’s the use of your deerskin cloak?
                The tangle’s inside you.
                You comb the outside.
              
              393-394*
              
                Wearing cast-off rags
                –his body lean & lined with veins–
                absorbed in jhana,
                alone in the forest:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              395
              
                I don’t call one a brahman
                for being born of a mother
                or sprung from a womb.
                He’s called a ‘bho-sayer’
                if he has anything at all.
                But someone with nothing,
                who clings to no thing:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.

                Having cut every fetter,
                he doesn’t get ruffled.
                Beyond attachment,
                unshackled:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              397
              
                Having cut the strap & thong,
                cord & bridle,
                having thrown off the bar,
                awakened:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              398*
              
                He endures–unangered–
                insult, assault, & imprisonment.
                His army is strength;
                his strength, forbearance:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              399
              
                Free from anger,
                duties observed,
                principled, with no overbearing pride,
                trained, a ‘last-body’:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              400*

                his own
                ending of stress.
                Unshackled, his burden laid down:

                Wise, profound

                as to what is the path
                & what’s not;
                his ultimate goal attained:

              404
              
                Having put aside violence
                against beings fearful or firm,
                he neither kills nor

              406
              
                His passion, aversion,
                conceit, & contempt,
                have fallen away–
                like a mustard seed

                what’s	non-grating,
                instructive,
                true–

                Here in the world
                he takes nothing not-given

              I have heard that on one occasion, the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree–the tree of awakening–newly awakened. And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. Then, with the passing of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the first watch of the night, he gave close attention to dependent co-arising in forward order,1 thus:
              When this is, that is.
              From the arising of this comes the arising of that.
              In other words:
              From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.
              From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.
              From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form.
              From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.
              From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.
              From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.

              From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.2
              From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.
              From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.
              From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-&-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering & stress.3
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                As phenomena grow clear
                to the brahman–ardent, in jhāna–
                his doubts all vanish
                when he discerns
                a phenomenon with its cause.

                1. In the parallel passage at Mv.I.1.2, the Buddha gives attention to dependent co-arising in both forward and reverse order.
                2. This hybrid word–clinging/sustenance–is a translation of the Pali term upādāna. Upādāna has a hybrid meaning because it is used to cover two sides of a physical process metaphorically applied to the mind: the act of clinging whereby a fire takes sustenance from a piece of fuel, together with the sustenance offered by the fuel. On the level of the mind, upādāna denotes both the act of clinging and the object clung to, which together give sustenance to the process of becoming and its attendant factors leading to suffering and stress. For more on this image and its implications for the practice, see The Mind Like Fire Unbound.
                3. Notice that dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda) is expressed in terms of processes–of events and actions–without reference to a framework containing those processes. In other words, it doesn’t mention the existence or non-existence of agents doing the actions, or of a framework in time and space in which these processes happen. Thus it makes possible a way of understanding the causes of suffering and stress without reference to the existence or non-existence of an “I” or an “other” responsible for those events. Instead, the events are viewed simply as events in the context of the process–a way of viewing that makes it possible to abandon clinging for any of these events, so as to bring suffering to an end. Even the idea of an “I” or an “other” is seen simply as part of the process (under the factors of fabrication and the sub-factor of attention under “name” in name-and-form). This is what makes possible the abandoning of any attachment to the conceit “I am,” as mentioned in Ud 2:1, 4:1, 6:6, and 7:1. In this way, the treatment of dependent co-arising in the first three udānas, while terse, actually sets the stage for understanding some of the more paradoxical teachings that appear later in the collection.
                For a discussion of dependent co-arising in general, see The Shape of Suffering. For further discussion of its role in framing and abandoning thoughts of “I am,” see Skill in Questions, chapters 3 and 8.

And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. At the end of seven days, he emerged from that concentration.
              Then a certain overbearing brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, “To what extent, Master Gotama, is one a brahman?

The Blessed One saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, addressed the monks, “Monks, those are brahmans who are coming. Monks, those are brahmans who are coming.”
              When this was said, a certain monk who was a brahman by birth said to the Blessed One, “To what extent, lord, is one a brahman? And which are the qualities that make one a brahman?”

Ānanda; the PTS version replaces him with Ven. Devadatta and Ven. Ānanda. These latter two readings would appear to be mistaken, as the Buddha in this sutta defines “brahman” as one whose fetters are ended–i.e., an arahant–whereas Ven. Ānanda became an arahant only after the Buddha’s passing; Devadatta, after having caused a split in the Saṅgha toward the end of the Buddha’s life, fell into hell.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. And on that occasion Ven. Mahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave, afflicted, in pain, & seriously ill. Then, at a later time, he recovered from his illness. When he had recovered from the illness, the thought occurred to him: “What if I were to go into Rājagaha for alms?”
              Now on that occasion 500 devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to Ven. Mahā Kassapa. But Ven. Mahā Kassapa, turning down those 500 devatās, early in the morning adjusted his under robe1 and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers. The Blessed One saw that Ven. Mahā Kassapa had gone into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                Supporting no others,
                unknown,2
                tamed, established
                in what is essential,
                effluents ended,
                anger disgorged:
                He’s what I call
                a brahman.

                1. According to the protocols given in Cv.VIII, a monk leaving a monastery in the wilderness with the purpose of going for alms would wear just his under robe, while carrying his upper and outer robes folded over his shoulder or upper back. On approaching an inhabited area he would stop and make sure that his under robe was neatly arranged: covering the area from above his navel to below his knees, and hanging down evenly in front and behind. Then he would put on his upper and outer robe, arranged so that the upper robe was a lining for the outer robe. If he was wearing sandals, he would take them off and place them in a small cloth bag. Only then would he enter the inhabited area for alms.
                2. There is an alliterative play of words here on anañña (no others) and aññāta (unknown).

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pāva at the Ajakalāpaka [Herd-of-Goats] shrine, the dwelling of the Ajakalāpaka spirit. And on that occasion, in the pitch-black darkness of the night, the Blessed One was sitting in the open air, and the rain was falling in scattered drops.
              Then the Ajakalāpaka spirit–wanting to cause fear, terror, & horripilation in the Blessed One–went to him and, on arrival, not far from him, three times made a commotion & pandemonium: “Commotion & pandemonium! Commotion & pandemonium! Commotion & pandemonium!–That’s a goblin for you, contemplative!”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                When,

                and his pandemonium.

                1. Dhammas. This is apparently a reference to skillful and unskillful mental qualities–which would mean that this sutta sides with the passages in the Canon categorizing unbinding not as a dhamma, but as the transcending of all dhammas. (The suttas in general are inconsistent on this point. Iti 90, among others, states clearly that unbinding counts as a dhamma. AN 10:58, on the other hand, calls unbinding the ending of all dhammas. Sn 5:6 calls the attainment of the goal the transcending of all dhammas, just as Sn 4:6 and Sn 4:10 state that the arahant has transcended dispassion, said to be the highest dhamma. MN 22, in the famous simile of the raft, states that all dhammas are abandoned at the end of the path.)

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. And on that occasion Ven. Saṅgāmaji had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One. His former wife heard, “Master Saṅgāmaji, they say, has arrived in Sāvatthī.” Taking her small child, she went to Jeta’s Grove. On that occasion Ven. Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding. His former wife went to him and, on arrival, said to him, “Look after me, contemplative–(a woman) with a little son.” When this was said, Ven. Saṅgāmaji remained silent. A second time… A third time, his former wife said to him, “Look after me, contemplative–(a woman) with a little son.” A third time, Ven. Saṅgāmaji remained silent.
              Then his former wife, taking the baby and leaving him in front of Ven. Saṅgāmaji, went away, saying, “That’s your son, contemplative. Look after him.”
              Then Ven. Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the child nor spoke to him. His wife, after going not far away, was looking back and saw Ven. Saṅgāmaji neither looking at the child nor speaking to him. On seeing this, the thought occurred to her, “The contemplative doesn’t even care about his son.” Returning from there and taking the child, she left.
              The Blessed One–with his divine eye, purified and surpassing the human–saw Ven. Saṅgāmaji’s former wife misbehaving in that way.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                At her coming,
                he didn’t delight;
                at her leaving,
                he didn’t grieve.

                1. This line is a double wordplay on Saṅgāmaji’s name. Literally, it means a victor in battle–a compound of saṅgāma (battle) and -ji (victor)–but the Buddha also extracts from the first member of the compound the word saṅgā, which means “from the tie.” Strictly speaking, saṅgāma and saṅgā are not related to each other. The ability to engage in wordplay using unrelated words like this was considered a sign of intelligence and wit.

And on that occasion, many ascetics–on the cold winter nights of the “Between-the-Eights,”1 when the snow was falling in Gayā–jumped up in the water, jumped down in the water, did a jumping-up-&-down in the water, poured (water over themselves), and performed the fire sacrifice, (thinking,) “Through this there is purity.”

The period between the first and last of these dates–the “Between-the-Eights”–is regarded in northern India as the coldest part of the year. See AN 3:35.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. And on that occasion Bāhiya of the Bark-cloth was living in Suppāraka by the seashore. He was worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage–a recipient of robes, alms food, lodgings, & medicinal requisites for the sick. Then, when he was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking appeared to his awareness: “Now, of those who in this world are arahants or have entered the path of arahantship, am I one?”
              Then a devatā who had once been a blood relative of Bāhiya of the Bark-cloth–compassionate, desiring his welfare, knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in his awareness–went to him and on arrival said to him, “You, Bāhiya, are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path of arahantship. You don’t even have the practice whereby you would become an arahant or enter the path of arahantship.”
              “Then who, in this world with its devas, are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship?”
              “Bāhiya, there is a city in the northern country named Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One–an arahant, rightly self-awakened–is living now. He truly is an arahant and teaches the Dhamma leading to arahantship.”
              Then Bāhiya, deeply chastened by the devatā, left Suppāraka right then and, in the space of one night,1 went all the way to where the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now on that occasion, a large number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air. He went to them and, on arrival, said, “Where, venerable sirs, is the Blessed One–the arahant, rightly self-awakened–now staying? We want to see that Blessed One–the arahant, rightly self-awakened.”
              “The Blessed One has gone into town for alms.”
              Then Bāhiya, hurriedly leaving Jeta’s Grove and entering Sāvatthī, saw the Blessed One going for alms in Sāvatthī–serene & inspiring serene confidence, calming, his senses at peace, his mind at peace, having attained the utmost tranquility & poise, tamed, guarded, his senses restrained, a Great One (nāga). Seeing him, he approached the Blessed One and, on reaching him, threw himself down, with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, and said, “Teach me the Dhamma, O Blessed One! Teach me the Dhamma, O One-Well-Gone, that will be for my long-term welfare & bliss.”
              When this was said, the Blessed One said to him, “This is not the time, Bāhiya. We have entered the town for alms.”
              A second time, Bāhiya said to the Blessed One, “But it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Blessed One’s life, or what dangers there may be for mine. Teach me the Dhamma, O Blessed One! Teach me the Dhamma, O One-Well-Gone, that will be for my long-term welfare & bliss.”
              A second time, the Blessed One said to him, “This is not the time, Bāhiya. We have entered the town for alms.”
              A third time, Bāhiya said to the Blessed One, “But it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Blessed One’s life, or what dangers there may be for mine. Teach me the Dhamma, O Blessed One! Teach me the Dhamma, O One-Well-Gone, that will be for my long-term welfare & bliss.”
              “Then, Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bāhiya, there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.”2
              Through hearing this brief explanation of the Dhamma from the Blessed One, the mind of Bāhiya of the Bark-cloth right then and there was released from effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance. Having exhorted Bāhiya of the Bark-cloth with this brief explanation of the Dhamma, the Blessed One left.
              Now, not long after the Blessed One’s departure, Bāhiya was attacked & killed by a cow with a young calf. Then the Blessed One, having gone for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, returning from his alms round with a large number of monks, saw that Bāhiya had died. On seeing him, he said to the monks, “Take Bāhiya’s body, monks, and, placing it on a litter and carrying it away, cremate it and build him a memorial. Your companion in the holy life has died.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, the monks–placing Bāhiya’s body on a litter, carrying it away, cremating it, and building him a memorial–went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to him, “Bāhiya’s body has been cremated, lord, and his memorial has been built. What is his destination? What is his future state?”
              “Monks, Bāhiya of the Bark-cloth was wise. He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma. Bāhiya of the Bark-cloth, monks, is totally unbound.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                Where water, earth,
                fire, & wind
                have no footing:

                a brahman through sagacity,
                has realized [this] for himself,
                then from form & formless,
                from bliss & pain,
                he is freed.

                1. Eka-ratti-parivāsena: This phrase can also mean, “taking one-night sojourns” (i.e., resting no more than one night in any one spot); or “with a one-night sojourn.” The Commentary prefers the meaning used in the translation, noting that the distance between Suppāraka and Sāvatthī amounts to 120 leagues, or approximately 1,200 miles. In its version of Bāhiya’s story, Bāhiya had no meditative attainments at all, and so the miraculous speed of his journey had to be attributed either to the power of the deva or the power of the Buddha. However, he may actually have had strong powers of concentration with some attendant psychic powers of his own.

              And on that occasion a great, out-of-season storm-cloud rose up, with seven days of rainy weather, cold winds, & intense darkness. Then Muccalinda the nāga king–leaving his dwelling place and encircling the Blessed One’s body seven times with his coils–stood with his great hood spread over the Blessed One, (thinking,) “Don’t let the Blessed One be disturbed by cold. Don’t let the Blessed One be disturbed by heat. Don’t let the Blessed One be disturbed by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, & creeping things.”
              Then, with the passing of seven days, the Blessed One emerged from that concentration. Muccalinda the nāga king, realizing that the sky had cleared and was free of clouds, unraveled his coils from the body of the Blessed One, dropped his own appearance and, assuming the appearance of a young man, stood in front of the Blessed One with hands before his heart, paying homage.

And on that occasion a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, were sitting gathered together in the assembly hall when this discussion arose: “Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the larger realm, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?” And this discussion came to no conclusion.
              Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the assembly hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat laid out. Seated, he addressed the monks: “For what topic are you sitting together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?”
              “Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we were sitting gathered here at the assembly hall when this discussion arose: ‘Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the larger realm, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?’ This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrived.”
              “It isn’t proper, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or noble silence.”1

But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage; nor were they recipients of robes, alms food, lodgings, or medicinal requisites for the sick.

So the wanderers of other sects, unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks, on seeing monks in village or wilderness, insult, revile, irritate, & harass them with discourteous, abusive language.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                When in contact with pleasure or pain
                in village or wilderness,
                don’t take it as yours or as others’.
                Contacts make contact

                Where there’s no sense of acquisition,

                with what?

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. And on that occasion the young wife of a certain wanderer was pregnant and on the verge of delivery. So she said to the wanderer, “Go, brahman, get some oil for my delivery.”
              When this was said, the wanderer said to her, “But where can I get any oil?”
              A second time, she said to him, “Go, brahman, get some oil for my delivery.”
              A second time, he said to her, “But where can I get any oil?”
              A third time, she said to him, “Go, brahman get some oil for my delivery.”
              Now on that occasion at the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala contemplatives & brahmans were being given as much oil or ghee as they needed to drink, but not to take away. So the thought occurred to the wanderer, “At present at the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala contemplatives & brahmans are being given as much oil or ghee as they need to drink, but not to take away. Suppose, having gone there, I were to drink as much oil as I need and, on returning home, vomiting it up, were to give it to use at this delivery?”
              So, having gone to the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala, he drank as much oil as he needed but, on returning home, was unable to bring it up or pass it down. So he rolled back & forth, suffering from fierce pains, sharp & severe. Then early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Sāvatthī for alms. He saw the wanderer rolling back & forth, suffering from fierce pains, sharp & severe.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Ud 2:8  Suppavāsā Sutta | Suppavāsā,Ud 2:8,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud2_8.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/2:8
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kuṇḍiya in the Kuṇḍiṭṭhāna forest. And on that occasion Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter had been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor. She–touched by fierce, sharp pains–endured them with three thoughts: “How rightly self-awakened is the Blessed One who, abandoning this sort of suffering, teaches the Dhamma! How well-practiced is the community of the Blessed One’s disciples who practice, abandoning this sort of suffering! How truly blissful is unbinding, where this sort of pain is not found!”
              Then Suppavāsā said to her husband, “Come, young master. Go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name, ask whether he is free from illness & affliction, is carefree, strong, & living in comfort, saying: ‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, lord, shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness & affliction, are carefree, strong, & living in comfort.’ And say this: ‘Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor. She–touched by fierce, sharp pains–endures them with three thoughts: “How rightly self-awakened is the Blessed One who, abandoning this sort of suffering, teaches the Dhamma! How well-practiced is the community of the Blessed One’s disciples who practice, abandoning this sort of suffering! How truly blissful is unbinding, where this sort of pain is not found!”’”
              Responding, “Excellent!” to Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, the Koliyan-son went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, lord, shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness & affliction, are carefree, strong, & living in comfort. And she says this: ‘Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor. She–touched by fierce, sharp pains–endures them with three thoughts: “How rightly self-awakened is the Blessed One who, abandoning this sort of suffering, teaches the Dhamma! How well-practiced is the community of the Blessed One’s disciples who practice, abandoning this sort of suffering! How truly blissful is unbinding, where this sort of pain is not found!”’”
              [The Blessed One said:] “May Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter be well & free from disease. And may she deliver a son free from disease.” And at the same time as the Blessed One’s statement, Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter–well & free from disease–delivered a son free from disease.
              Saying, “Very well, lord,” the Koliyan-son, delighting in & approving of the Blessed One’s words, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One and–circling him to the right–returned to his home. He saw that Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter–well & free from disease–had delivered a son free from disease. On seeing this, the thought occurred to him, “How amazing! How astounding!–the Tathāgata’s great power, great might, in that, at the same time as the Blessed One’s statement, Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter–well & free from disease–would deliver a son free from disease!” Gratified, he was joyful, rapturous, & happy.
              Then Suppavāsā said to her husband, “Come, young master. Go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name, saying: ‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, lord, shows reverence with her head to your feet.’ And say this: ‘Suppavāsā, who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor, has now–well & free from disease–delivered a son free from disease. She invites the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, for seven days of meals. May the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsā’s seven meals, together with the community of monks.’”
              Responding, “Excellent!” to Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, the Koliyan-son went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, lord, shows reverence with her head to your feet. And she says this: ‘Suppavāsā, who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor, has now–well & free from disease–delivered a son free from disease. She invites the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, for seven days of meals. May the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsā’s seven meals, together with the community of monks.’”
              Now at that time a certain lay follower had invited the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, for the next day’s meal. That lay follower was a supporter of Ven. Mahā Moggallāna. So the Blessed One addressed Ven. Mahā Moggallāna, “Come, Moggallāna. Go to the lay follower and, on arrival, say to him, ‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor, has now–well & free from disease–delivered a son free from disease. She has invited the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, for seven days of meals. Let Suppavāsā do seven meals. Afterward, you will do yours.’ He’s your supporter.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Moggallāna went to the lay follower and, on arrival, said to him, “Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter, who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor, has now–well & free from disease–delivered a son free from disease. She has invited the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, for seven days of meals. Let Suppavāsā do seven meals; afterward, you will do yours.”
              “Venerable sir, if Ven. Moggallāna will be my guarantor for three things–(my) wealth, life, & faith–then let Suppavāsā do seven meals; afterward, I will do mine.”
              “For two things, friend, will I be your guarantor: your wealth & life. Only you are the guarantor of your faith.”
              “Venerable sir, if Ven. Moggallāna will be my guarantor for two things–(my) wealth & life–then let Suppavāsā do seven meals; afterward, I will do mine.”
              Then Ven. Moggallāna, having conciliated the lay follower, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, said, “The lay follower, lord, has been conciliated. Let Suppavāsā do seven meals; afterward, he will do his.”
              So for seven days Suppavāsā the Koliyan-daughter with her own hand served & satisfied the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, with exquisite staple & non-staple food. And she had the child show reverence to the Blessed One and the community of monks. Then Ven. Sāriputta said to the child, “I trust, child, that things are bearable for you. I trust that things are comfortable for you. I trust that there’s no pain.”
              “From where, Ven. Sāriputta, would things be bearable for me? From where would they be comfortable for me living seven years in a belly of blood?”1
              Then Suppavāsā–(thinking,) “My son is conversing with the Dhamma General!”–was gratified, joyful, rapturous, & happy.
              The Blessed One, knowing that Suppavāsā was gratified, joyful, rapturous, & happy, said to her, “Suppavāsā, would you like to have another son like this?”
              “Lord Blessed One2, I would like to have seven more sons like this!”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                The disagreeable
                in the guise of the agreeable,

So in the middle of the day she went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Anupiyā in the Mango Grove. And on that occasion, Ven. Bhaddiya, Kāḷigodhā’s son, on going to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, would repeatedly exclaim, “What bliss! What bliss!”
              A large number of monks heard Ven. Bhaddiya, Kāḷigodhā’s son, on going to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaim, “What bliss! What bliss!” and on hearing him, the thought occurred to them, “There’s no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya, Kāḷigodhā’s son, doesn’t enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that when going to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, he is repeatedly exclaiming, ‘What bliss! What bliss!’”
              So they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they told him, “Ven.

              “Yes, lord.”
              “What compelling reason do you have in mind that–when going to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling–you repeatedly exclaim, ‘What bliss! What bliss!’?”
              “Before, when I has a householder, maintaining the bliss of kingship,1 lord, I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments, within and without the city, within and without the countryside. But even though I was thus guarded, thus protected, I dwelled in fear–agitated, distrustful, & afraid. But now, on going alone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, I dwell without fear, unagitated, confident, & unafraid–unconcerned, unruffled, living on the gifts of others, with my mind like a wild deer.

              Responding, “As you say, my friend,” to the monk, Ven. Nanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, “Is it true, Nanda, that you have announced to a large number of monks: ‘I don’t enjoy leading the holy life, my friends. I can’t keep up the holy life. Giving up the training, I will return to the common life’?”
              “Yes, lord.”
              “But why, Nanda, don’t you enjoy leading the holy life? Why can’t you keep up the holy life? Why, giving up the training, will you return to the common life?”
              “Lord, as I was leaving home, a Sakyan girl–the envy of the countryside–glanced up at me, with her hair half-combed, and said, ‘Hurry back, master.’ Recollecting that, I don’t enjoy leading the holy life. I can’t keep up the holy life. Giving up the training, I will return to the common life.”
              Then, taking Ven. Nanda by the arm–as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm–the Blessed One disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared among the Devas of the Heaven of the Thirty-three [Tāvatiṁsa]. Now on that occasion about 500 dove-footed nymphs had come to wait upon Sakka, the ruler of the devas. The Blessed One said to Ven. Nanda, “Nanda, do you see these 500 dove-footed nymphs?”
              “Yes, lord.”
              “What do you think, Nanda? Which is lovelier, better looking, more charming: the Sakyan girl, the envy of the countryside, or these 500 dove-footed nymphs?”
              “Lord, compared to these 500 dove-footed nymphs, the Sakyan girl, the envy of the countryside, is like a cauterized monkey with its ears & nose cut off. She doesn’t count. She’s not even a small fraction. There’s no comparison. The 500 dove-footed nymphs are lovelier, better looking, more charming.”
              “Then take joy, Nanda. Take joy! I am your guarantor for getting 500 dove-footed nymphs.”
              “If the Blessed One is my guarantor for getting 500 dove-footed nymphs, I will enjoy leading the holy life under the Blessed One.”
              Then, taking Ven. Nanda by the arm–as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm–the Blessed One disappeared from among the Devas of the Heaven of the Thirty-three and reappeared at Jeta’s Grove. The monks heard, “They say that Ven. Nanda–the Blessed One’s brother, son of his maternal aunt–is leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs. They say that the Blessed One is his guarantor for getting 500 dove-footed nymphs.”
              Then the monks who were companions of Ven. Nanda went around addressing him as they would a hired hand & a person who had been bought: “Venerable Nanda, they say, has been hired. Venerable Nanda, they say, has been bought.1 He’s leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs. The Blessed One is his guarantor for getting 500 dove-footed nymphs.”
              Then Ven. Nanda–humiliated, ashamed, & disgusted that the monks who were his companions were addressing him as they would a hired hand & a person who had been bought–went to dwell alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute. He in no long time entered & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself right in the here-&-now. He knew, “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And thus Ven. Nanda became another one of the arahants.
              Then a certain devatā, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she said to the Blessed One, “Lord, Ven. Nanda–the Blessed One’s brother, son of his maternal aunt–through the ending of the effluents, has entered & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing them for himself right in the here-&-now.” And within the Blessed One, the knowledge arose: “Nanda, through the ending of the effluents, has entered & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing them for himself right in the here-&-now.”
              Then, when the night had passed, Ven. Nanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, about the Blessed One’s being my guarantor for getting 500 dove-footed nymphs: I hereby release the Blessed One from that promise.”
              “Nanda, having comprehended your awareness with my own awareness, I realized that ‘Nanda, through the ending of the effluents, has entered & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing them for himself right in the here-&-now.’ And a devatā informed me that ‘Ven. Nanda, through the ending of the effluents, has entered & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, directly knowing & realizing them for himself right in the here-&-now.’ When your mind, through lack of clinging, was released from the effluents, I was thereby released from that promise.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                In whom
                the mire of sensuality is crossed over,2
                the thorn of sensuality crushed,
                the ending of delusion reached:
                He doesn’t quiver
                from pleasures & pains
                : a monk.

                1. The monks here address Ven. Nanda as “āyasmant.” According to DN 16, they did not normally address one another in this formal way while the Buddha was still alive. Thus there is an element of sarcasm in the way they use the term here.
                2. Reading yassa tiṇṇo kāmapaṅko with the Thai edition. The Burmese, Sri Lankan, and PTS editions read, yassa nittiṇṇo paṅko: “In whom the mire is crossed over.” The parallel passage in the Udānavarga (32.2) essentially agrees with this latter version.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. And on that occasion approximately 500 monks, headed by Ven. Yasoja, had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One. As these visiting monks were exchanging greetings with the resident monks, setting their lodgings in order, and putting away their robes & bowls, they made a loud racket, a great racket. Then the Blessed One said to Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, what is that loud racket, that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fish?”
              “Lord, those are approximately 500 monks, headed by Ven. Yasoja, who have arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One. As these visiting monks are exchanging greetings with the resident monks, setting their lodgings in order, and putting away their robes & bowls, they are making a loud racket, a great racket.”
              “In that case, Ānanda, tell those monks in my name, ‘The Teacher calls you, friends.’”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda went to the monks and said, “The Teacher calls you, friends.”
              Responding, “As you say, friend,” to Ven. Ānanda, the monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to them, “Monks, why were you making that loud racket, that great racket, like fishermen with a catch of fish?”
              When this was said, Ven. Yasoja said to the Blessed One, “Lord, these 500 monks have arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One. As they were exchanging greetings with the resident monks, setting their lodgings in order, and putting away their robes & bowls, they made a loud racket, a great racket.”
              “Go away, monks. I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my vicinity.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, the monks got up from their seats, bowed down to the Blessed One, and left, circling him to the right. Setting their lodgings in order and taking their robes & bowls, they went wandering among the Vajjians. After wandering by stages among the Vajjians, they came to the River Vaggamudā. There on the bank of the River Vaggamudā they made leaf-huts and entered the Rains Retreat.
              Then Ven. Yasoja addressed the monks as they entered the Rains Retreat: “Friends, the Blessed One dismissed us, wishing for our benefit, seeking our wellbeing, being sympathetic, and acting out of sympathy. Let’s live in such a way that the Blessed One will be gratified by our way of living.”
              “As you say, friend,” the monks responded to Ven. Yasoja. And so, living secluded, ardent, & resolute, every one of them realized the Three Knowledges [remembrance of past lives, knowledge of the arising & passing away of living beings, and knowledge of the ending of mental effluents] in the course of that very Rains Retreat.
              Then the Blessed One, having stayed as long as he liked in Sāvatthī, went wandering in the direction of Vesālī. After wandering by stages, he arrived in Vesālī and stayed there in the Gabled Pavilion in the Great Forest. Then, encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the monks staying on the bank of the River Vaggamudā, he said to Ven. Ānanda, “This direction seems bright to me, Ānanda. This direction seems dazzling to me. It’s not at all repugnant for me to go & pay attention to where the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā are staying. Send a messenger into their presence to say, ‘The Teacher calls you, friends. The Teacher wants to see you.’”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda went to a certain monk and said, “Come now, friend. Go to the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā and say to them, ‘The Teacher calls you, friends. The Teacher wants to see you.’”
              Responding, “As you say, friend,” to Ven. Ānanda, the monk–just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm–disappeared from the Gabled Pavilion in the Great Forest and appeared in front of the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā. Then he said to them, “The Teacher calls you, friends. The Teacher wants to see you.”
              Responding, “As you say, friend,” to the monk, the monks set their lodgings in order and, taking their robes & bowls, disappeared from the bank of the River Vaggamudā–just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm–and appeared in the presence of the Blessed One in the Gabled Pavilion in the Great Forest.
              Now, at that time the Blessed One was sitting in imperturbable concentration [either in the fourth jhāna, the dimension of the infinitude of space, or the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness]. The thought occurred to the monks, “Now, in which mental dwelling is the Blessed One now residing?” Then they realized, “He is residing in the imperturbable dwelling.” So they all sat in imperturbable concentration.
              Then Ven. Ānanda–when the night was far advanced, at the end of the first watch–got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, stood facing the Blessed One, paying homage with his hands placed palm-to-palm over his heart, and said to him, “The night, lord, is far advanced. The first watch has ended. The visiting monks have been sitting here a long time. May the Blessed One greet them.” When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.
              Then a second time, when the night was far advanced, at the end of the middle watch, Ven. Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, stood facing the Blessed One, paying homage to him with his hands placed palm-to-palm over his heart, and said to him, “The night, lord, is far advanced. The middle watch has ended. The visiting monks have been sitting here a long time. May the Blessed One greet them.” When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.
              Then a third time, when the night was far advanced, at the end of the last watch, as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming, Ven. Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, stood facing the Blessed One, paying homage to him with his hands placed palm-to-palm over his heart, and said to him, “The night, lord, is far advanced. The last watch has ended. Dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming. The visiting monks have been sitting here a long time. May the Blessed One greet them.”
              Then the Blessed One, emerging from his imperturbable concentration, said to Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, if you had known, not even that much would have occurred to you (to say).1 I, along with all 500 of these monks, have been sitting in imperturbable concentration.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                In whom they’re defeated–
                the thorn of sensuality,

                & imprisonment:

It’s not out of inner hatred that he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes. For 500 consecutive lifetimes the monk Vaccha has been born in brahman families.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. And on that occasion Ven. Mahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave, sitting for seven days in a single session, having attained a certain level of concentration. Then, with the passing of seven days, he emerged from that concentration. To him, emerging from that concentration, the thought occurred: “What if I were to go into Rājagaha for alms?”
              Now on that occasion 500 devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to Ven. Mahā Kassapa. But Ven. Mahā Kassapa, turning down those 500 devatās, early in the morning adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Rājagaha for alms.
              Now on that occasion Sakka, the deva-king, wanted to give alms to Ven. Mahā Kassapa. So, assuming the appearance of a weaver, he was working a loom, while Sujātā, an asura-maiden, filled the shuttle. Then, as Ven. Mahā Kassapa was going on an almsround that bypassed no donors1 in Rājagaha, he arrived at Sakka’s home. Sakka saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, came out of house to meet him. Taking the bowl from his hand, entered the house, took cooked rice from the pot, filled the bowl, and gave it back to Ven. Mahā Kassapa. And that gift of alms included many kinds of curry, many kinds of sauces.
              The thought occurred to Ven. Mahā Kassapa, “Now, who is this being with such power & might as this?” Then the thought occurred to him, “This is Sakka, the deva-king, isn’t it?” On realizing this, he said to Sakka, “Is this your doing, Kosiya?2 Don’t ever do anything like this again.”
              “We, too, need merit, Ven. Kassapa. We, too, have use for merit.”
              Then, bowing down to Ven. Mahā Kassapa and circling him to the right, Sakka rose up into the air and, while up in the sky, exclaimed three times:
              “O the alms, the foremost alms, well-established in Kassapa!”
              “O the alms, the foremost alms, well-established in Kassapa!”
              “O the alms, the foremost alms, well-established in Kassapa!”

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. And on that occasion a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, were sitting gathered together at the kareri-tree pavilion when this discussion arose: “Friends, an alms-collecting monk,1 while going for alms, periodically sees agreeable sights via the eye. He periodically hears agreeable sounds via the ear… smells agreeable aromas via the nose… tastes agreeable flavors via the tongue… touches agreeable tactile sensations via the body. An alms-collecting monk, while going for alms, is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and given homage.
              “So, friends, let’s become alms-collecting monks. Then we, too, while going for alms, will periodically get to see agreeable sights via the eye… to hear agreeable sounds via the ear… to smell agreeable aromas via the nose… to taste agreeable flavors via the tongue… to touch agreeable tactile sensations via the body. We, too, while going for alms, will be honored, respected, revered, venerated, and given homage.” And this discussion came to no conclusion.
              Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the kareri-tree pavilion and, on arrival, sat down on a seat laid out. Seated, he addressed the monks: “For what topic are you sitting together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?”
              “Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we were sitting gathered together here at the kareri-tree pavilion when this discussion arose: [They repeat what had been said.]”
              “It isn’t proper, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or noble silence.”2
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, were sitting gathered together at a pavilion when this discussion arose: “Who, friends, knows a craft? Who’s studying which craft? Which is the supreme among crafts?”
              With regard to that, some said, “The elephant-craft is the supreme craft among crafts.” Some said, “The horse-craft is the supreme craft among crafts” … “The chariot-craft…” … “Archery…” … “Swordsmanship…” … “Signaling1…” … “Calculating…” … “Accounting…” … “Writing…” … “Literary composition…” … “Cosmology…” Some said, “Geomancy is the supreme craft among crafts.” And this discussion came to no conclusion.
              Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the pavilion and, on arrival, sat down on a seat laid out. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: “For what topic are you sitting together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?”
              “Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we were sitting gathered together here at the pavilion when this discussion arose: [They repeat what had been said.]”
              “It isn’t proper, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or noble silence.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Ud 3:10  Loka Sutta | Surveying the World,Ud 3:10,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud3_10.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/3:10
              I have heard that on one occasion, the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree–the tree of awakening–newly awakened. And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. Then, with the passing of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One. As he did so, he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion, aversion, & delusion.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, he on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                This world is burning.
                Afflicted by contact,
                it calls disease a ‘self.’
                By whatever means it supposes [anything],
                it becomes otherwise than that.1
                Becoming otherwise,
                the world is
                attached to becoming,
                afflicted by becoming,
                and yet delights
                in that very becoming.
                Where there’s delight,
                there is fear.
                What one fears
                is stressful.
                This holy life is lived
                for the abandoning of becoming.
              
              Whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming, all of them are not released from becoming, I say.
              And whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of non-becoming, all of them have not escaped from becoming, I say.
              
                For this stress comes into play
                in dependence on every acquisition.2
                With the ending of every clinging/sustenance,
                there’s no stress coming into play.
                Look at this world:
                Beings, afflicted with thick ignorance,
                are unreleased
                from passion for what has come to be.
                All levels of becoming,
                anywhere,
                in any way,
                are inconstant, stressful, subject to change.
                Seeing this–as it’s come to be–
                with right discernment,
                one abandons craving for becoming
                and doesn’t delight in non-becoming.3
                From the total ending of craving
                comes fading & cessation without remainder:
                unbinding.
                For the monk unbound
                through lack of clinging/sustenance,
                there’s no further becoming.
                He has conquered Māra,
                won the battle,
                having gone beyond becomings

                1. In other words, regardless of whatever one bases one’s construal of an experience on, by the time the construal is complete, the base has already changed.
                2. Reading sabb’upadhiṁ hi with the Thai edition. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions read upadhiṁ hi: “For this stress comes into play in dependence on acquisition.” The parallel passage in the Udānavarga (32.36) agrees with this latter version.
                3. This passage indicates the way out of the dilemma posed above, that one cannot gain release either through becoming or non-becoming. Rather than focus on whether one wants to take “what has come to be” in the direction of becoming or non-becoming, one develops dispassion for “what has come to be” as it occurs, and this provides the way out. On this point, see The Paradox of Becoming, chapters 2 and 6.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Cālikans, at Cālikā Mountain. And on that occasion Ven. Meghiya was his attendant. Then Ven. Meghiya went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One, “I would like to go into Jantu Village for alms.”
              “Then do, Meghiya, what you think it is now time to do.”
              Then in the early morning, Ven. Meghiya adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Jantu Village for alms. Having gone for alms in Jantu Village, after the meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the bank of the Kimikālā River. As he was walking up & down along the bank of the river to exercise his legs, he saw a pleasing, charming mango grove. Seeing it, the thought occurred to him: “How pleasing & charming this mango grove! It’s enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself [in meditation]. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to exert myself [in meditation] in this mango grove.”
              So Ven. Meghiya went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Just now, in the early morning, I adjusted my under robe and–carrying my bowl & robes–went into Jantu Village for alms. Having gone for alms in Jantu Village, after the meal, returning from my alms round, I went to the bank of the Kimikālā River. As I was walking up & down along the bank of the river to exercise my legs, I saw a pleasing, charming mango grove. Seeing it, the thought occurred to me: ‘How pleasing & charming this mango grove! It’s enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself [in meditation]. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to exert myself [in meditation] in this mango grove.’ If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself [in meditation].”
              When this was said, the Blessed One responded to Ven. Meghiya, “As long as I am still alone, stay here until another monk comes.”
              A second time, Ven. Meghiya said to the Blessed One, “Lord, the Blessed One has nothing further to do, and nothing further to add to what he has done. I, however, have something further to do, and something further to add to what I have done. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself [in meditation].”
              A second time, the Blessed One responded to Ven. Meghiya, “As long as I am still alone, stay here until another monk comes.”
              A third time, Ven. Meghiya said to the Blessed One, “Lord, the Blessed One has nothing further to do, and nothing further to add to what he has done. I, however, have something further to do, and something further to add to what I have done. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself [in meditation].”
              “As you are talking about exertion, Meghiya, what can we say? Do what you think it is now time to do.”
              Then Ven. Meghiya, rising from his seat, bowing down to the Blessed One and, circling him to the right, went to the mango grove. On arrival, having gone deep into the grove, he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the day’s abiding.
              Now while Ven. Meghiya was staying in the mango grove, he was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts: thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of doing harm. The thought occurred to him: “How amazing! How astounding! Even though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life, still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts: thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of doing harm.”
              Emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Just now, while I was staying in the mango grove, I was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts: thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of doing harm. The thought occurred to me: ‘How amazing! How astounding! Even though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life, still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts: thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of doing harm.’”
              “Meghiya, in one whose awareness-release is still immature, five qualities bring it to maturity. Which five?
              “There is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues. In one whose awareness-release is still immature, this is the first quality that brings it to maturity.
              “Furthermore, the monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior & range of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults. In one whose awareness-release is still immature, this is the second quality that brings it to maturity.
              “Furthermore, he gets to hear at will, easily and without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness, i.e., talk on modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge & vision of release. In one whose awareness-release is still immature, this is the third quality that brings it to maturity.
              “Furthermore, he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful [mental] qualities and for taking on skillful qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities. In one whose awareness-release is still immature, this is the fourth quality that brings it to maturity.
              “Furthermore, he is discerning, endowed with the discernment related to arising & passing away–noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. In one whose awareness-release is still immature, this is the fifth quality that brings it to maturity.
              “Meghiya, in one whose awareness-release is still immature, these are the five qualities that bring it to maturity.
              “Meghiya, when a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, it is to be expected that he will be virtuous, will dwell restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior & range of activity, and will train himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.
              “When a monk has admirable people as friends & colleagues, it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will, easily and without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness, i.e., talk on modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge & vision of release.
              “When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualities–steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.
              “When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, & colleagues, it is to be expected that he will be discerning, endowed with the discernment relating to arising & passing away–noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress.
              “And furthermore, when the monk is established in these five qualities, there are four additional qualities he should develop: He should develop [contemplation of] the unattractive so as to abandon passion. He should develop good will so as to abandon ill will. He should develop mindfulness of in-&-out breathing so as to cut off thinking. He should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit, ‘I am.’1 For a monk perceiving inconstancy, the perception of not-self is made steady. One perceiving not-self attains the uprooting of the conceit, ‘I am’–unbinding right in the here-&-now.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                Little thoughts, subtle thoughts,
                when followed, stir up the heart.

Then, coming down from the road, he went to a certain tree, and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out. A certain cowherd then went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One, instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged him with Dhamma-talk. The cowherd–instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged by the Blessed One’s talk on Dhamma–said to him, “Lord, may the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow’s meal.”
              The Blessed One acquiesced with silence.

              Then, after the night had passed, the cowherd–having prepared in his own home a great deal of thick milk-rice porridge & fresh ghee–announced the time of the meal to the Blessed One: “It’s time, lord. The meal is ready.”
              So the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went together with the community of monks to the cowherd’s home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat laid out. The cowherd, with his own hand, served & satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milk-rice porridge & fresh ghee. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had rinsed his bowl & hands, the cowherd, taking a lower seat, sat down to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One, instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged him with Dhamma-talk, then got up from his seat & left.
              Now, not long after the Blessed One’s departure, the cowherd was killed by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages.

Mahā Moggallāna were staying in Pigeon Cave. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. Sāriputta–his head newly shaven–was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of concentration.
              And on that occasion two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other. They saw Ven. Sāriputta–his head newly shaven–sitting in the open air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, “I’m inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head.”
              When this was said, the second yakkha said to the first, “Enough of that, my good friend. Don’t lay a hand on the contemplative. He’s an outstanding contemplative, of great power & great might.”

              Then the first yakkha, ignoring the second yakkha, gave Ven. Sāriputta a blow on the head. And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a great rocky crag. But right there the yakkha–yelling, “I’m burning!”–fell into the Great Hell.
              Now, Ven. Moggallāna–with his divine eye, pure and surpassing the human–saw the yakkha give Ven. Sāriputta a blow on the head. Seeing this, he went to Ven.

              “I am well, friend Moggallāna. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache.”
              “How amazing, friend Sāriputta! How astounding! How great your power & might! Just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head. So great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a great rocky crag. But all you say is this: ‘I am well, friend Moggallāna. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache’!”
              “How amazing, friend Moggallāna! How astounding! How great your power & might! Where you saw a yakkha just now, I didn’t even see a dust devil!”
               The Blessed One–with the divine ear-property, pure and surpassing the human–heard those two great beings conversing in this way. Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Ud 4:5  Nāga Sutta | The Bull Elephant,Ud 4:5,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud4_5.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/4:5
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kosambī at Kosita’s monastery. And on that occasion the Blessed One lived hemmed in with monks, nuns, male & female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, & their disciples. Hemmed in, he lived unpleasantly and not in ease. The thought occurred to him: “I now live hemmed in by monks, nuns, male & female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, & their disciples. Hemmed in, I live unpleasantly and not in ease. What if I were to live alone, apart from the crowd?”
              So, early in the morning, the Blessed One adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Kosambī for alms. Then, having gone for alms in Kosambī, after the meal, returning from his alms round, he set his own lodgings in order and, carrying his bowl & robes, without telling his attendant, without informing the community of monks–alone & without a companion–left on a wandering tour toward Palileyyaka. After wandering by stages, he reached Palileyyaka. There he stayed in Palileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious sal tree.
              It so happened that a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants, cow-elephants, calf-elephants, & baby elephants. He fed off grass with cut-off tips. They chewed up his stash of broken-off branches. He drank disturbed water. And when he came up from his bathing-place, cow-elephants went along, banging up against his body. Hemmed in, he lived unpleasantly and not in ease. The thought occurred to him: “I now live hemmed in by elephants, cow-elephants, calf-elephants, & baby elephants. I feed off grass with cut-off tips. They chew up my stash of broken-off branches. I drink disturbed water. And when I come up from my bathing place, cow-elephants go along, banging up against my body. Hemmed in, I live unpleasantly and not in ease. What if I were to live alone, apart from the crowd?”
              So the bull elephant, leaving the herd, went to Palileyyaka, to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal tree–to where the Blessed One was staying. There he kept the grass down in the area where the Blessed One was staying, and brought drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One with his trunk.
              Then, when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to his awareness: “Before, I lived hemmed in by monks, nuns, male & female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, & their disciples. Hemmed in, I lived unpleasantly and not in ease. But now I live not hemmed in by monks, nuns, male & female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, & their disciples. Not hemmed in, I live pleasantly and in ease.”
              And this train of thought appeared to the awareness of the bull elephant, “Before, I lived hemmed in by elephants, cow-elephants, calf-elephants, & baby elephants. I fed off grass with cut-off tips. They chewed up my stash of broken-off branches. I drank disturbed water. And when I came up from my bathing place, cow-elephants went along, banging up against my body. Hemmed in, I lived unpleasantly and not in ease. But now I live not hemmed in by elephants, cow-elephants, calf-elephants, & baby elephants. I feed off grass with uncut tips. They don’t chew up my stash of broken-off branches. I drink undisturbed water. When I come up from my bathing place, cow-elephants don’t go along, banging up against my body. Not hemmed in, I live pleasantly and in ease.”1
              Then the Blessed One, realizing his own seclusion and knowing the train of thought in the bull elephant’s awareness, on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                This
                harmonizes

                in the forest.

Ud 4:8  Sundarī Sutta | Sundarī,Ud 4:8,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud4_8.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/4:8
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the Blessed One was worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage–a recipient of robes, alms food, lodgings, & medicinal requisites for the sick. The community of monks was also worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage–a recipient of robes, alms food, lodgings, & medicinal requisites for the sick. But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage; nor were they recipients of robes, alms food, lodgings, or medicinal requisites for the sick.
              So the wanderers of other sects–unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks–went to Sundarī the female wanderer and, on arrival, said to her, “Sundarī, would you dare to do something for the benefit of your kinsmen?”
              “What shall I do, masters? What can I not do?1 I have given up even my life for the benefit of my kinsmen!”
              “In that case, sister, go often to Jeta’s Grove.”
              Responding, “As you say, masters,” to those wanderers of other sects, Sundarī the female wanderer went often to Jeta’s Grove. When the wanderers of other sects knew that many people had seen Sundarī the female wanderer going often to Jeta’s Grove, then–having murdered her and buried her right there in the moat-ditch surrounding Jeta’s Grove–they went to King Pasenadi Kosala and, on arrival, said to him, “Great king, we can’t find Sundarī the female wanderer.”
              “But where do you suspect she is?”
              “At Jeta’s Grove, great king.”
              “Then in that case, search Jeta’s Grove.”
              Then those wanderers of other sects, having searched Jeta’s Grove, having dug up what they had buried in the surrounding moat-ditch, having mounted it on a litter, took it into Sāvatthī and went from street to street, crossroad to crossroad, stirring up people’s indignation: “See, masters, the handiwork of the Sakyan-son contemplatives. They’re shameless, these Sakyan-son contemplatives: unvirtuous, evil-natured, liars, unholy, though they claim to be practicing the Dhamma, practicing what is harmonious, practicing the holy life, speakers of the truth, virtuous, fine-natured. They have no quality of a contemplative, no holy quality. Destroyed is their quality of a contemplative! Destroyed is their holy quality! From where is their quality of a contemplative? From where, their holy quality? Gone are they from any quality of a contemplative! Gone from any holy quality! How can a man, having done a man’s business with a woman, take her life?”
              So on that occasion, people seeing monks in Sāvatthī would insult, revile, irritate, & harass them with discourteous, abusive language: “They’re shameless, these Sakyan-son contemplatives: unvirtuous, evil-natured, liars, unholy, though they claim to be practicing the Dhamma, practicing what is harmonious, practicing the holy life, speakers of the truth, virtuous, fine-natured. They have no quality of a contemplative, no holy quality. Destroyed is their quality of a contemplative! Destroyed is their holy quality! From where is their quality of a contemplative? From where, their holy quality? Gone are they from any quality of a contemplative! Gone from any holy quality! How can a man, having done a man’s business with a woman, take her life?”
              Then, early in the morning, a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and–carrying their bowls & robes–went into Sāvatthī for alms. Then, having gone for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One, “At present, lord, people seeing monks in Sāvatthī insult, revile, irritate, & harass them with discourteous, abusive language: ‘They’re shameless, these Sakyan-son contemplatives: unvirtuous, evil-natured, liars, unholy…. How can a man, having done a man’s business with a woman, take her life?’”
              “Monks, this noise will not last long. It will last only seven days. With the passing of seven days, it will disappear. So in that case, when those people, on seeing monks, insult, revile, irritate, & harass them with discourteous, abusive language, counter their accusation with this verse:
              
                “He goes to hell,
                the one who asserts
                what didn’t take place,
                as does the one
                who, having done,
                says, ‘I didn’t.’
                Both–low-acting people–
                there become equal:
                after death, in the world beyond.”2
              
              So, having learned this verse in the Blessed One’s presence, the monks–whenever people, on seeing monks in Sāvatthī, insulted, reviled, irritated, & harassed them with discourteous, abusive language–countered the accusation with this verse:
              
                “He goes to hell,
                the one who asserts
                what didn’t take place,
                as does the one
                who, having done,
                says, ‘I didn’t.’
                Both–low-acting people–
                there become equal:
                after death, in the world beyond.”
              
              The thought occurred to those people, “They’re innocent, these Sakyan-son contemplatives. It wasn’t done by them.3 They’re taking an oath, these Sakyan-son contemplatives.” And so that noise didn’t last long. It lasted only seven days. With the passing of seven days, it disappeared.
              Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to him, “It’s amazing, lord. It’s astounding–how well-said that was by the Blessed One: ‘Monks, this noise will not last long. It will last only seven days. With the passing of seven days, it will disappear.’ Lord, that noise has disappeared.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

                1. Following the Sri Lankan and Burmese editions. In the Thai edition, this sentence reads, less effectively, “What can I do?”
                2. This verse = Dhp 306.
                3. Reading na imehi kataṁ, sapant’ime samaṇā sakya-puttiyā with the Sri Lankan and Burmese editions. The Thai reads, less grammatically, na imehi kataṁ, pāpant’ime samaṇā sakya-puttiyā.
                4. Because sarehi can mean either “with arrows” or “with voices,” this verse can also be translated:
                
                  They goad with their words
                  –people unrestrained–
                  as they do, with shouts,
                  a tusker gone into battle.
                
                The verse thus yields two equally valid interpretations:
                a) The people stabbing the elephant with arrows (sarehi) are enemy soldiers, trying to bring it down.
                b) The people goading the elephant with their shouts and voices (sarehi) are soldiers fighting on the same side as the elephant, urging it to charge into danger.
                The Commentary gives only the first interpretation. But if we accept both interpretations, the verse contains a more useful double warning: When there’s a controversy, beware of the unrestrained people on both sides. Learn to endure the hurtful words of those on the other side who want to bring you down, and the hurtful words of those on your side who try to rouse your anger so that you will say something rash.

Fortunate has been my life; fortunate will be my death.”
              Then the Blessed One, comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had appeared to Ven. Upasena Vaṅgantaputta’s awareness, on that occasion exclaimed:

Enlightened (dhīra): Throughout this translation I have rendered buddha as “awakened,” and dhīra as “enlightened.” As Jan Gonda points out in his book, The Vision of the Vedic Poets, the word dhīra was used in Vedic and Buddhist poetry to mean a person who has the heightened powers of mental vision needed to perceive the “light” of the underlying principles of the cosmos, together with the expertise to implement those principles in the affairs of life and to reveal them to others. A person enlightened in this sense may also be awakened, but is not necessarily so.

And on that occasion King Pasenadi Kosala had gone with Queen Mallikā to the upper palace. Then he said to her, “Mallikā, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?”
              “No, great king. There is no one dearer to me than myself. And what about you, great king? Is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?”
              “No, Mallikā. There is no one dearer to me than myself.”
              Then the king, descending from the palace, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Just now, lord, when I had gone with Queen Mallikā to the upper palace, I said to her, ‘Mallikā, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?’

Ud 5:3  Kuṭṭhi Sutta | The Leper,Ud 5:3,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud5_3.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/5:3
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. And on that occasion in Rājagaha there was a leper named Suppabuddha, a poor, pitiful wretch of a person. And on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. Suppabuddha the leper saw the large gathering of people from afar and thought to himself, “Without a doubt, someone must be distributing staple or non-staple food there. Why don’t I go over to that large group of people, and maybe there I’ll get some staple or non-staple food.” So he went over to the large group of people. Then he saw the Blessed One sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. On seeing this, he realized, “There’s no one distributing staple or non-staple food there. That’s Gotama the contemplative (sitting) surrounded, teaching the Dhamma. Why don’t I listen to the Dhamma?” So he sat down to one side right there, [thinking,] “I, too, will listen to the Dhamma.”
              Then the Blessed One, having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness, asked himself, “Now who here is capable of understanding the Dhamma?” He saw Suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assembly, and on seeing him the thought occurred to him, “This person here is capable of understanding the Dhamma.” So, aiming at Suppabuddha the leper, he gave a step-by-step talk, i.e., he proclaimed a talk on generosity, on virtue, on heaven; he declared the drawbacks, degradation, & corruption of sensuality, and the rewards of renunciation. Then when the Blessed One knew that Suppabuddha the leper’s mind was ready, malleable, free from hindrances, elevated, & clear, he then gave the Dhamma-talk peculiar to Awakened Ones, i.e., stress, origination, cessation, & path. And just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb a dye, in the same way, as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat, the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye arose within him, “Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.”
              Having seen the Dhamma, reached the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, gained a foothold in the Dhamma, having crossed over & beyond doubt, having had no more perplexity, having gained fearlessness & independence from others with regard to the Teacher’s message, he got up from his seat and went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One–through many lines of reasoning–made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life.”
              Then Suppabuddha the leper, having been instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged by the Blessed One’s Dhamma talk, delighting in & approving of the Blessed One’s words, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One and left, circling him to the right. Not long after his departure he was attacked & killed by a cow with a young calf.
              Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, “Lord, the leper named Suppabuddha, whom the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged with a Dhamma talk, has died. What is his destination? What is his future state?”
              “Monks, Suppabuddha the leper was wise. He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma. With the destruction of the first three fetters, he is a stream-winner, not subject to states of deprivation, headed for self-awakening for sure.”
              When this was said, one of the monks said to the Blessed One, “Lord, what was the cause, what was the reason, why Suppabuddha the leper was such a poor, pitiful wretch of a person?”
              “Once, monks, in this very Rājagaha, Suppabuddha the leper was the son of a rich money-lender. While being escorted to a pleasure park, he saw Tagarasikhin the Private Buddha1 going for alms in the city. On seeing him, the thought occurred to him, ‘Who is this leper prowling about?’ Spitting and disrespectfully turning his left side to Tagarasikhin the Private Buddha, he left. As a result of that deed he boiled in hell for many years, many hundreds of years, many thousands of years, many hundreds of thousands of years. And then as a remainder of the result of that deed he became a poor, pitiful wretch of a person in this very Rājagaha. But on encountering the Dhamma & Vinaya made known by the Tathāgata, he acquired conviction, virtue, learning, relinquishment, & discernment. Having acquired conviction, virtue, learning, relinquishment, & discernment on encountering the Dhamma & Vinaya made known by the Tathāgata, now–on the break-up of the body, after death–he has reappeared in a good destination, a heavenly world, in company with the Devas of the Heaven of the Thirty-three. There he outshines the other devas both in beauty & in rank.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                As one with eyes & having energy
                would
                treacherous, uneven places,
                so a wise one, in the world of life,
                should
                avoid

                1. A Private Buddha is one who gains awakening without relying on the teachings of others, but who cannot formulate the Dhamma to teach others in the way a Full Buddha can.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra’s mother. And on that occasion, the Blessed One–it being the observance day–was sitting surrounded by the community of monks. Then Ven. Ānanda–when the night was far advanced, at the end of the first watch–got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, stood facing the Blessed One, paying homage with his hands placed palm-to-palm over his heart, and said to him, “Lord, the night is far advanced. The first watch has ended. The community of monks has been sitting here long. May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them.” When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.
              Then a second time, when the night was far advanced, at the end of the middle watch, Ven. Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, stood facing the Blessed One, paying homage with his hands placed palm-to-palm over his heart, and said to him, “Lord, the night is far advanced. The second watch has ended. The community of monks has been sitting here long. May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them.” When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.
              Then a third time, when the night was far advanced, at the end of the last watch, as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming, Ven. Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, stood facing the Blessed One, paying homage with his hands placed palm-to-palm over his heart, and said to him, “Lord, the night is far advanced. The last watch has ended. Dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming. The community of monks has been sitting here long. May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monks.”
              “Ānanda, the gathering isn’t pure.”
              Then the thought occurred to Ven. Mahā Moggallāna: “In reference to which individual did the Blessed One just now say, ‘Ānanda, the gathering isn’t pure’?” So he directed his mind, encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the entire community of monks. He saw that individual–unprincipled, evil, unclean and suspect in his undertakings, hidden in his actions, not a contemplative though claiming to be one, not leading the holy life though claiming to do so, inwardly rotten, oozing with desire, filthy by nature–sitting in the midst of the community of monks. On seeing him, he got up, went over to that individual, and on reaching him said, “Get up, friend. You have been seen by the Blessed One. You have no affiliation with the community of monks.” Then the individual remained silent. A second time…. A third time, Ven. Mahā Moggallāna said, “Get up, friend. You have been seen by the Blessed One. You have no affiliation with the community of monks.” And for a third time the individual remained silent.
              Then Ven. Mahā Moggallāna, grabbing that individual by the arm, having expelled him through the outside door of the porch and locking the bolt, approached the Blessed One and on arrival said, “I have expelled that individual, lord. The gathering is now pure. Let the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monks.”
              “Isn’t it amazing, Moggallāna. Isn’t it astounding, how that worthless man waited until he was grabbed by the arm.” Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “From now on I will no longer perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha. From now on, you alone, monks, will perform the observance and recite the Pāṭimokkha. It is impossible, it cannot happen, that a Tathāgata would perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha with an impure gathering.

                1. Na āyataken’eva papāto: literally, “not for quite a long stretch a sudden drop-off.” The Commentary, however, insists that this phrase means, “with no abrupt drop-off.” There are three reasons for not accepting the Commentary’s interpretation here. (a) The first is grammatical. The word āyataka means “long, drawn out; lasting a long time.” To interpret āyatakena, the instrumental of a word meaning “long, drawn out,” to mean “abrupt” makes little sense. (b) The second reason is geographical. The continental shelf off the east coast of India does have a sudden drop-off after a long gradual slope. (c) The third reason is doctrinal. As noted in the interpretation of the simile, the shape of the ocean floor corresponds to the course of the practice. If there were no sudden drop-off, there would be no sudden penetration to awakening. However, there are many cases of sudden penetration in the Canon, Exhibit A being Bāhiya’s attainment of arahantship in Ud 1:10.

Then as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to his awareness: “According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches, it’s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?”
              So he went to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival, having bowed down to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, “Just now, venerable sir, as I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to my awareness: ‘According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches, it’s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’ Give me the going-forth, Master Mahā Kaccāna!”
              When this was said, Ven. Mahā Kaccāna said to Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa, “It’s hard, Soṇa, the life-long, one-meal-a-day, sleeping-alone holy life. Please, right there as you are a householder, devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the proper-time [i.e., uposatha day], one-meal-a-day, sleeping-alone holy life.” And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa’s idea of going-forth subsided.
              Then a second time as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to his awareness: “According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches, it’s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?”
              So he went to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival, having bowed down to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, “Just now, venerable sir, as I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to my awareness: ‘According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches, it’s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’ Give me the going-forth, Master Mahā Kaccāna!”
              When this was said, Ven. Mahā Kaccāna said to Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa, “It’s hard, Soṇa, the life-long, one-meal-a-day, sleeping-alone holy life. Please, right there as you are a householder, devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the proper-time, one-meal-a-day, sleeping-alone holy life.” And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa’s idea of going-forth subsided a second time.
              Then a third time as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to his awareness: “According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches, it’s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?”
              So he went to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival, having bowed down to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, “Just now, venerable sir, as I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to my awareness: ‘According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches, it’s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’ Give me the going-forth, Master Mahā Kaccāna!”
              So Ven. Mahā Kaccāna gave Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa the going-forth.
              Now at that time the southern country of Avantī was short of monks. So only after three years–having gathered from here & there with hardship & difficulty a quorum-of-ten community of monks1–did Ven. Mahā Kaccāna give full admission to Ven. Soṇa. Then, after having completed the Rains retreat, as he was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to Ven. Soṇa’s awareness: “I haven’t seen the Blessed One face-to-face. I’ve simply heard that he is like this and like this. If my preceptor would give me permission, I would go to see the Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened.”
              So, leaving seclusion in the late afternoon, he went to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, “Just now, venerable sir, as I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought appeared to my awareness: ‘I haven’t seen the Blessed One face-to-face. I’ve simply heard that he is like this and like this. If my preceptor would give me permission, I would go to see the Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened.’”
              “Good, Soṇa. Very good. Go, Soṇa, to see the Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened. You will see the Blessed One who is serene & inspires serene confidence, his senses at peace, his mind at peace, one who has attained the utmost tranquility & poise, tamed, guarded, his senses restrained, a Great One (nāga). On seeing him, showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name,2 ask whether he is free from illness & affliction, is carefree, strong, & living in comfort, [saying: ‘My preceptor, lord, shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness & affliction, are carefree, strong, & living in comfort.’”]3
              Saying, “As you say, venerable sir,” Ven. Soṇa–delighting in & approving of Ven. Mahā Kaccāna’s words–got up from his seat, bowed down to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, circled him to the right, set his lodging in order, and–taking his bowl & robes–set off wandering toward Sāvatthī. Wandering by stages, he arrived at Sāvatthī, Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. He went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, my preceptor, Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, shows reverence with his head to the Blessed One’s feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness & affliction, is carefree, strong, & living in comfort.”
              “Are you well, monk? Are you in good health? Have you come along the road with only a little fatigue? And are you not tired of alms-food?”
              “I am well, Blessed One. I am in good health, Blessed One. I have come along the road, lord, with only a little fatigue and I am not tired of alms-food.”
              Then the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, saying, “Ānanda, prepare bedding for this visiting monk.”
              Then the thought occurred to Ven. Ānanda, “When the Blessed One orders me, ‘Ānanda, prepare bedding for this visiting monk,’ he wants to stay in the same dwelling with that monk. The Blessed One wants to stay in the same dwelling with Ven. Soṇa.” So he prepared bedding for Ven. Soṇa in the dwelling in which the Blessed One was staying. Then the Blessed One, having spent much of the night sitting in the open air, washed his feet and entered the dwelling. Likewise, Ven. Soṇa, having spent much of the night sitting in the open air, washed his feet and entered the dwelling. Then, getting up toward the end of the night, the Blessed One invited Ven. Mahā Soṇa,4 saying, “Monk, I would like you to recite the Dhamma.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Soṇa chanted all sixteen parts of the Aṭṭhaka Vagga.5 The Blessed One, at the conclusion of Ven. Soṇa’s intonation, expressed high approval: “Good, monk. Very good. You have learned the Aṭṭhaka Vagga [verses] well, have considered them well, have borne them well in mind. You have a fine delivery, clear & faultless, that makes the meaning intelligible. How many Rains [in the monkhood] do you have?”
              “I have one Rains, Blessed One.”
              “But why did you take so long [to ordain]?”
              “For a long time, lord, I have seen the drawbacks in sensuality, but the household life is confining with many duties, many things to be done.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                Seeing the drawbacks of the world,
                knowing the state without acquisitions,
                a noble one doesn’t find joy in evil,
                in evil
                a clean one doesn’t find joy.6
              
              
                ",No Introduction,"s
                1. Originally, a quorum of at least ten monks was required to ordain a new monk. In the version of this story given in the Vinaya (Mv.V.13.1-13), Ven. Mahā Kaccāna sends a request to the Buddha via Ven. Soṇa that some of the Vinaya rules be relaxed outside of the middle Ganges valley, one of them being that the quorum required for ordination be reduced. As a result, the Buddha amended the relevant rule, stating that the quorum of ten was needed only within the middle Ganges valley, and that outside of the middle Ganges valley a quorum of five would be sufficient to ordain a new monk, provided that at least one of the five be knowledgeable in the Vinaya.
                2. The remainder of this paragraph does not appear in Mv.V.13.5. However, at this point in the story, Mv.V.13.5-7 inserts Ven. Mahā Kaccāna’s request that Ven. Soṇa, in his name, ask the Buddha to rescind four of the monks’ rules in the Southern region, and that he explain a procedure dealing with gifts of cloth that Ven. Mahā Kaccāna found unclear.
                3. The passage in brackets appears in the PTS and Burmese editions, but not in the Thai and Sri Lankan editions.
                4. This is the only point in the sutta where Ven. Soṇa has the prefix “Great” (Mahā) added to his name.
                5. This is apparently the Aṭṭhaka Vagga as we now have it in Sn 4.
                6. At Mv.V.13.10, the PTS version of this last line reads, “In the teaching a clean one finds joy.” However, in the Thai, Burmese, and Sri Lankan versions of the same passage, the last line is the same as here.

                1. This relates to the question of whether pleasure and pain are self-caused or other-caused. As Ud 6:5 and Ud 6:6 show, this question was a hot topic in the time of the Buddha. However, in SN 12:20, SN 12:35, and SN 12:67 the Buddha refuses to get involved in the issue. See the discussion in Skill in Questions, chapter 8.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ refuge. And on that occasion, early in the morning of the uposatha, Ven. Ānanda adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Rājagaha for alms. Devadatta saw Ven. Ānanda going for alms in Rājagaha and, on seeing him, went to him. On arrival, he said to him, “From this day forward, friend Ānanda, I will conduct the uposatha & community transactions apart from the Blessed One, apart from the community of monks.”
              Then Ven. Ānanda–having gone for alms in Rājagaha, after the meal, returning from his alms round–went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.

                1. There’s a slight paradox in this verse in that the word for “steady” (ṭhita) can also mean “standing.” Thus when the body is steady and unmoving, it is “standing” regardless of its posture.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. Then, early in the morning, he adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Vesālī for alms. Then, having gone for alms in Vesālī, after the meal, returning from his alms round, he addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Get a sitting cloth, Ānanda. We will go to the Pāvāla shrine for the day’s abiding.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda followed along behind the Blessed One, carrying the sitting cloth. Then the Blessed One went to the Pāvāla shrine and, on arrival, sat down on the seat laid out.
              Seated, the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Vesālī is refreshing, Ānanda. Refreshing, too, are the Udena shrine, the Gotamaka shrine, the Sattamba shrine, the ManySon shrine, the Sāranda shrine, the Pāvāla shrine.1
              “Anyone, Ānanda, in whom the four bases of power2 are developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, and well-undertaken, could–if he wanted–remain for an eon or the remainder of an eon.3 In the Tathāgata, Ānanda, the four bases of power are developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, and well-undertaken. He could–if he wanted–remain for an eon or the remainder of an eon.”
              But Ven. Ānanda–even when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign, such a blatant hint–wasn’t able to understand his meaning. He didn’t request of him, “Lord, may the Blessed One remain for an eon. May the One-Well-Gone remain for an eon–for the benefit of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of human and divine beings.” It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra.
              A second time… A third time, the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Vesālī is refreshing, Ānanda. Refreshing, too, are the Udena shrine, the Gotamaka shrine, the Sattamba shrine, the ManySon shrine, the Sāranda shrine, the Pāvāla shrine.
              “Anyone, Ānanda, in whom the four bases of power are developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, and well-undertaken, could–if he wanted–remain for an eon or the remainder of an eon.

              But Ven. Ānanda–even when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign, such a blatant hint–wasn’t able to understand his meaning. He didn’t request of him, “Lord, may the Blessed One remain for an eon. May the One-Well-Gone remain for an eon–for the benefit of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of human and divine beings.” It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra.
              Then the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Go, Ānanda. Do what you think it is now time to do.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One and–after circling him to the right–went to sit under a tree not far from the Blessed One.
              Then, not long after Ven. Ānanda had left, Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, stood to one side. As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One totally unbind now, lord. May the One-Well-Gone totally unbind now, lord. Now is the time for the Blessed One’s total unbinding, lord. After all, these words were said by the Blessed One: ‘Evil One, I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced, trained, attained to confidence, desiring rest from the yoke, learned, maintaining the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma; declaring the Dhamma–after having learned it from their own teachers–teaching it, describing it, setting it forth, revealing it, explaining it, making it plain; well-refuting, in line with the Dhamma, any opposing teachings that have arisen; teaching the Dhamma with its marvels.’4

              “But now, lord, the Blessed One’s female lay-follower disciples are experienced, trained, attained to maturity, desiring rest from the yoke, learned, maintaining the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma; declaring the Dhamma–after having learned it from their own teachers–teaching it, describing it, setting it forth, revealing it, explaining it, making it plain; well-refuting, in line with the Dhamma, any opposing teachings that have arisen; teaching the Dhamma with its marvels.
              “May the Blessed One totally unbind now, lord. May the One-Well-Gone totally unbind now, lord. Now is the time for the Blessed One’s total unbinding, lord. After all, these words were said by the Blessed One: ‘Evil One, I will not totally unbind as long as this holy life of mine is not powerful, prosperous, widely-spread, disseminated among many people, well-expounded as far as there are devas & human beings.’ But now, lord, the Blessed One’s holy life is powerful, prosperous, widely-spread, disseminated among many people, well-expounded as far as there are devas & human beings.
              “May the Blessed One totally unbind now, lord. May the One-Well-Gone totally unbind now, lord. Now is the time for the Blessed One’s total unbinding, lord.”
              When this was said, the Blessed One said to Māra, the Most Evil One: “Relax, Evil One. It won’t be long until the Tathāgata’s total unbinding. In three months’ time from now, the Tathāgata will totally unbind.”
              Thus at the Pāvāla shrine–mindful & alert–the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life.5 And as the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life, there was a great earthquake, frightening & hair-raising, along with cracks of thunder.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

                1. As DN 16 makes clear, there were several times in the past where the Buddha, at several different locations, had commented to Ven. Ānanda on how refreshing it was to be in the location where they were staying. This apparently was meant as a sign that living on would not be a burden, for in each case he had then given a broad hint–as he does here–for Ven. Ānanda to invite him to extend his life. As says in the narrative immediately following the events portrayed in this udāna, he would have refused the invitation if offered only twice, but would have accepted it on the third offer. But now that he has abandoned the will to live, he cannot take it on again, so Ven. Ānanda’s final opportunity to make the invitation is lost.
                2. “And what is the base of power? Whatever path, whatever practice, leads to the attainment of power, the winning of power: That is called the base of power.
                “And what is the development of the base of power? There is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire & the fabrications of exertion. He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence… concentration founded on intent… concentration founded on discrimination & the fabrications of exertion. This is called the development of the base of power.” – SN 51:26
                3. An eon, in the Buddhist cosmology, is an immensely long stretch of time. According to the Commentary here, it can also mean the full lifespan of a human being in that particular period of the eon (Buddhist cosmology allows for a huge fluctuation in human lifespans over the course of an eon). The Commentary adopts this second meaning in this passage, and so takes the Buddha’s statement here as meaning that a person who has developed the bases of power could live for a full lifespan or for a little bit more. In this case, the Pali for the last part of this compound, kappāvasesaṁ, would mean, “an eon plus a remainder.”
                4. DN 11 defines the miracle of instruction as instruction in training the mind to the point of where it gains release from all suffering and stress.
                5. In other words, the Buddha relinquished the will to live longer. It was this relinquishment that led to his total Unbinding three months later.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra’s mother. And on that occasion the Blessed One, having emerged from his seclusion in the late afternoon, was sitting outside the doorway of the porch. Then King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
              Now on that occasion seven coiled-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven cloth-less ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, & seven wanderers–their nails, armpit-hair, & body-hair grown long, carrying containers on poles [over their shoulders]–walked past, not far from the Blessed One. King Pasenadi Kosala saw the seven coiled-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven cloth-less ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, & seven wanderers–their nails, armpit-hair, & body-hair grown long, carrying containers on poles [over their shoulders]–walking past, not far from the Blessed One. On seeing them, he got up from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt down with his right knee on the ground, paid homage to the seven coiled-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven cloth-less ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, & seven wanderers with his hands palm-to-palm in front his heart, and announced his name three times: “I am the king, venerable sirs, Pasenadi Kosala. I am the king, venerable sirs, Pasenadi Kosala. I am the king, venerable sirs, Pasenadi Kosala.”
              Then not long after the seven coiled-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven cloth-less ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, & seven wanderers had passed, King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Of those in the world who are arahants or on the path to arahantship, are these among them?”
              “Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures; living confined with children; using Kāsī fabrics & sandalwood; wearing garlands, scents, & creams; handling gold & silver, it’s hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantship.
              “It’s through living together that a person’s virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
              “It’s through trading with a person that his purity may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
              “It’s through adversity that a person’s endurance may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
              “It’s through discussion that a person’s discernment may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.”
              “Amazing, lord! Astounding!–how well that was put by the Blessed One! ‘Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures; living confined with children; using Kāsī fabrics & sandalwood; wearing garlands, scents, & creams; handling gold & silver, it’s hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantship.
              “‘It’s through living together that a person’s virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
              “‘It’s through trading with a person that his purity may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
              “‘It’s through adversity that a person’s endurance may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.

              “These men, lord, are my spies, my scouts, returning after going out through the countryside. They go out first, and then I go. Now, when they have scrubbed off the dirt & mud, are well-bathed & well-perfumed, have trimmed their hair and beards, and have put on white clothes, they will go about endowed and provided with the five strings of sensuality.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                One
                should not make an effort everywhere,
                should not be another’s hireling,

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. And on that occasion there were many contemplatives, brahmans, & wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views, differing opinions, differing beliefs, dependent for support on their differing views. Some of the contemplatives & brahmans held this doctrine, this view: “The cosmos is eternal. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.”
              Some of the contemplatives & brahmans held this doctrine, this view: “The cosmos is not eternal” … “The cosmos is finite” … “The cosmos is infinite” … “The soul is the same thing as the body” … “The soul is one thing and the body another” … “After death a Tathāgata exists” … “After death a Tathāgata does not exist” … “After death a Tathāgata both exists & does not exist” … “After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.”
              And they kept on arguing, quarreling, & disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, “The Dhamma is like this, it’s not like that. The Dhamma’s not like that, it’s like this.”
              Then in the early morning, a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and–carrying their bowls & robes–went into Sāvatthī for alms. Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, “Lord, there are many contemplatives, brahmans, & wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views, differing opinions, differing beliefs, dependent for support on their differing views…. And they keep on arguing, quarreling, & disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, ‘The Dhamma is like this, it’s not like that. The Dhamma’s not like that, it’s like this.’”

The Dhamma’s not like that, it’s like this.’
              “Once, monks, in this same Sāvatthī, there was a certain king, and the king said to a certain man, ‘Come, my good man. Gather together all the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth.’”
              “Responding, ‘As you say, your majesty,’ to the king, the man–having rounded up all the people in Sāvatthī who had been blind from birth–went to the king and on arrival said, ‘Your majesty, the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth have been gathered together.’
              “‘Very well then, I say, show the blind people an elephant.’
              “Responding, ‘As you say, your majesty,’ to the king, the man showed the blind people an elephant. To some of the blind people he showed the elephant’s head, saying, ‘This, blind people, is what an elephant is like.’ To some of them he showed the elephant’s ear, saying, ‘This, blind people, is what an elephant is like.’ To some of them he showed the elephant’s tusk… the elephant’s trunk… the elephant’s body… the elephant’s foot… the elephant’s hindquarters… the elephant’s tail… the tuft at the end of the elephant’s tail, saying, ‘This, blind people, is what an elephant is like.’
              “Then, having shown the blind people the elephant, the man went to the king and on arrival said, ‘Your majesty, the blind people have seen the elephant. May your majesty do what you think it is now time to do.’
              “Then the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them, ‘Blind people, have you seen the elephant?’
              “‘Yes, your majesty. We have seen the elephant.’
              “‘Now tell me, blind people, what the elephant is like.’
              “The blind people who had been shown the elephant’s head said, ‘The elephant, your majesty, is just like a jar.’
              “Those who had been shown the elephant’s ear said, ‘The elephant, your majesty, is just like a winnowing basket.’
              “Those who had been shown the elephant’s tusk said, ‘The elephant, your majesty, is just like a plowshare.’1
              “Those who had been shown the elephant’s trunk said, ‘The elephant, your majesty, is just like the pole of a plow.’
              “Those who had been shown the elephant’s body said, ‘The elephant, your majesty, is just like a granary.’

              “Those who had been shown the tuft at the end of the elephant’s tail said, ‘The elephant, your majesty, is just like a broom.’
              “Saying, ‘The elephant is like this, it’s not like that. The elephant’s not like that, it’s like this,’ they struck one another with their fists. That gratified the king.
              “In the same way, monks, the wanderers of other sects are blind & eyeless. They don’t know what is beneficial and what is harmful.

This compound–tamogadhaṁ–is ambiguous in that it can be divided in two ways: tam-ogadhaṁ, “that footing”; or tamo-gadhaṁ, “a footing in darkness.” The first is the meaning apparently intended here, with “that footing” referring to the deathless (the image is of the point, when crossing a river, where one comes close enough to the far shore that one can touch bottom–see AN 10:58). However, the Buddha was probably conscious that the compound could also be interpreted in the second way, which would have made the term memorable for its shock value. There are several other passages in Pali poetry where terms seem to have been intended to carry both positive and negative meanings for this reason. See, for example, Dhp 97, Sn 4:10, and Sn 4:13.

And on that occasion two factions in Rājagaha were infatuated with a certain courtesan, their minds enthralled. Arguing, quarreling, & disputing, they attacked one another with fists, attacked one another with clods of dirt, attacked one another with sticks, attacked one another with knives, so that they fell into death or death-like pain.
              Then in the early morning, a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and–carrying their bowls & robes–went into Sāvatthī for alms. Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, “At present, two factions in Rājagaha are infatuated with a certain courtesan, their minds enthralled.

                and the holy life whose essence is service:
                This is one extreme.
                Any who say, “There’s no harm in sensual desires”:
                This, the second extreme.
                Both of these extremes cause the growth of cemeteries,

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Ven. Mahā Kaccāna was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well-established to the fore within. The Blessed One saw Ven. Mahā Kaccāna sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well-established to the fore within.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                If one were to have
                mindfulness always
                established, continually
                immersed in the body,
                (thinking,)
                “It should not be,
                it should not be mine;
                it will not be,
                it will not be mine”1–
                there,
                in that step-by-step dwelling,
                one in no long time
                would cross over
                attachment.

                1. This passage can also be translated as:
                
                  “It should not be,
                  it should not occur to me;
                  it will not be,
                  it will not occur to me.”
                
              
              In AN 10:29, the Buddha recommends this view as conducive to developing dispassion for becoming. However, in MN 106 he warns that it can lead to the refined equanimity of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, which can become an object of clinging. Only if that subtle clinging is detected can all clinging be abandoned.
              The Canon’s most extended discussion of this theme of meditation is in SN 22:55. See Appendix Two.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Mallans, together with a large community of monks, and came to a brahman village of the Mallans named Thūna. The brahman householders of Thūna heard that “Gotama the Sakyan contemplative, gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is wandering among the Mallans together with a large community of monks, and has arrived at Thūna.” So they filled the well all the way to the brim with grass & chaff, [thinking], “Don’t let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.”
              Then the Blessed One, going down from the road, went to a certain tree, and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out. Seated, he said to Ven. Ānanda: “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some drinking water from that well.”
              When this was said, Ven. Ānanda replied, “Just now, lord, the brahman householders of Thūna filled that well all the way to the brim with grass & chaff, [thinking], ‘Don’t let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.’”
              A second time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ānanda: “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some drinking water from that well.”
              A second time, Ven. Ānanda replied, “Just now, lord, the brahman householders of Thūna filled that well all the way to the brim with grass & chaff, [thinking], ‘Don’t let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.’”
              A third time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ānanda: “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some drinking water from that well.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda–taking a bowl–went to the well. As he was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass & chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim–streaming, as it were–with pristine water, undisturbed & clear. The thought occurred to him, “How amazing! How astounding!–the great power & great might of the Tathāgata!–in that, while I was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass & chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim–streaming, as it were–with pristine water, undisturbed & clear.”
              Taking drinking water in his bowl, he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said, “How amazing, lord!

              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kosambī at Ghosita’s monastery. And on that occasion the inner quarters of King Udena’s royal park had burned down, and 500 women, headed by Sāmāvatī, had died.
              Then in the early morning, a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and–carrying their bowls & robes–went into Kosambī for alms. Having gone for alms in Kosambī, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, “Lord, the inner quarters of King Udena’s royal park have burned down, and 500 women, headed by Sāmāvatī, have died. What is the destination of those female lay followers? What is their future course?”
              “Monks, among those female lay followers are stream-winners, once-returners, & non-returners. All of those female lay followers, monks, died not without [noble] fruit.”

                There is, monks, an unborn1–unbecome–unmade–unfabricated. If there were not that unborn–unbecome–unmade–unfabricated, there would not be the case that escape from the born–become–made–fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn–unbecome–unmade–unfabricated, escape from the born–become–made–fabricated is discerned.2
              
              
                ",No Introduction,"s
                1. Some scholars have argued that the term “unborn” cannot be used to distinguish unbinding from transmigration, as there are discourses (such as SN 15:3) stating that transmigration itself has no beginning point, implying that it too is unborn. Thus they argue that in this passage the term ajātaṁ, although a past participle, should be translated as, “without birth.” However, this argument is based on two questionable premises. First, it assumes that unbinding is here being contrasted with transmigration, even though the passage simply contrasts it with the fabricated. Secondly, even assuming that the phrase “the born–the become,” etc., is a reference to transmigration, the scholars’ argument is based on a misreading of SN 15:3. There, transmigration is said to have an “inconceivable” or “undiscoverable” beginning point. This is very different from saying that it is unborn. If transmigration were unborn, it would be unfabricated (see AN 3:47), which is obviously not the case. Thus, in translating this term to describe unbinding, I have maintained the straight grammatical reading, “unborn.”
                2. Iti 43 gives this exclamation as the synopsis of a Dhamma talk, followed by this verse:
                
                  The born, become, produced,
                  made, fabricated, impermanent,
                  fabricated of aging & death,
                  a nest of illnesses, perishing,
                  come-into-being through nourishment
                  and the guide [that is craving]–
                  is unfit for delight.
                  
                    The escape from that
                    is
                    calm, permanent,
                    a sphere beyond conjecture,

              I have heard that on one occasion, while the Blessed One was wandering among the Mallans with a large community of monks, he arrived at Pāvā. There he stayed near Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda the silversmith.
              Cunda the silversmith heard, “The Blessed One, they say, while wandering among the Mallans with a large community of monks and reaching Pāvā, is staying near Pāvā in my mango grove.”
              So Cunda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged him with Dhamma-talk. Then Cunda–instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged by the Blessed One’s Dhamma-talk–said to him, “Lord, may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow, together with the community of monks.”
              The Blessed One acquiesced with silence.
              Then Cunda, understanding the Blessed One’s acquiescence, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, and left, circling him to the right. Then, at the end of the night, after having exquisite staple & non-staple food–including a large amount of pig-delicacy1–prepared in his own home, he announced the time to the Blessed One: “It’s time, lord. The meal is ready.”
              Then the Blessed One, early in the morning, adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went together with the community of monks to Cunda’s home. On arrival, he sat down on the seat laid out. Seated, he said to Cunda, “Cunda, serve me with the pig-delicacy you have had prepared, and the community of monks with the other staple & non-staple food you have had prepared.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Cunda served the Blessed One with the pig-delicacy he had had prepared, and the community of monks with the other staple & non-staple food he had had prepared. Then the Blessed One said to him, “Cunda, bury the remaining pig-delicacy in a pit. I don’t see anyone in the world–together with its devas, Māras, & Brahmas, with its people with their contemplatives & brahmans, their royalty & commonfolk–in whom, when it was ingested, it would go to a healthy change, aside from the Tathāgata.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Cunda buried the remaining pig-delicacy in a pit, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, after bowing down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One–after instructing, urging, rousing, & encouraging him with Dhamma-talk–got up from his seat and left.
              Then in the Blessed One, after he had eaten Cunda’s meal, there arose a severe illness accompanied with (the passing of) blood, with intense pains & deadly. But the Blessed One endured it–mindful, alert, & not struck down by it.
              Then he addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, we will go to Kusinarā.”
              “As you say, lord,” Ven. Ānanda responded to the Blessed One.
              
                I have heard that,
                on eating Cunda the silversmith’s meal,
                the enlightened one was touched by illness–
                fierce, deadly.
                After he had eaten the pig-delicacy,
                a fierce sickness arose in the Teacher.
                After being purged of it,
                the Blessed One said,
                “To the city of Kusinarā
                I will go.”2
              
              Then the Blessed One, going down from the road, went to a certain tree and, on arrival, said to Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, please arrange my outer robe folded in four. I am tired. I will sit down.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda arranged the outer robe folded in four. The Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out.
              Seated, he said to Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, please fetch me some water. I am thirsty. I will drink.”
              When this was said, Ven. Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “Lord, just now 500 carts have passed through. The meager river–cut by the wheels–flows turbid & disturbed. But the Kukuṭa river is not far away, with pristine water, pleasing water, cool water, pellucid water,3 with restful banks, refreshing. There the Blessed One will drink potable water and cool his limbs.”
              A second time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, please fetch me some water. I am thirsty. I will drink.”
              A second time, Ven. Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “Lord, just now 500 carts have passed through. The meager water–cut by the wheels–flows turbid & disturbed. But the Kukuṭa River is not far away, with pristine water, pleasing water, cool water, pellucid water, with restful banks, refreshing.

              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda–taking a bowl–went to the river. And the meager river that, cut by the wheels, had been flowing turbid & disturbed, on his approach flowed pristine, clear, & undisturbed. The thought occurred to him, “How amazing! How astounding!–the great power & great might of the Tathāgata!–in that this meager river that, cut by the wheels, was flowing turbid & disturbed, on my approach flowed pristine, clear, & undisturbed!” Fetching water with the bowl, he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said, “How amazing! How astounding!–the great power & great might of the Tathāgata!–in that this meager river that, cut by the wheels, was flowing turbid & disturbed, on my approach flowed pristine, clear, & undisturbed! Drink the water, O Blessed One! Drink the water, O One-Well-Gone!”
              Then the Blessed One drank the water.4
              Then the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, went to the Kukuṭa River and, after arriving at the Kukuṭa River, going down, bathing, drinking, & coming back out, went to a mango grove. On arrival, the Blessed One said to Ven. Cundaka, “Cundaka, please arrange my outer robe folded in four. I am tired. I will lie down.”
              Responding, “As you say, lord,” to the Blessed One, Ven. Cundaka arranged the outer robe folded in four. The Blessed One, lying on his right side, took up the lion’s posture, placing one foot on top of the other–mindful, alert, and attending to the perception of getting up. Ven. Cundaka sat in front of him.

                –having gone to the little Kukuṭa river
                with its pristine, pleasing water, clear–

                the Tathāgata, unequalled in the world
                went down, bathed, drank, & came out.

                in the midst of the group of monks,
                the Blessed One, Teacher,
                proceeding here in the Dhamma,
                the great seer,
                went to the mango grove.
                He addressed the monk named Cundaka,
                “Spread it out, folded in four
                for me to lie down.”
                Ordered by the One of developed mind,
                Cundaka quickly set it out, folded in four.
                The Teacher lay down, seeming very tired,
                and Cundaka sat down there before him.
              
              Then the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, if anyone tries to incite remorse in Cunda the silversmith, saying, ‘It’s no gain for you, friend Cunda, it’s ill-done by you, that the Tathāgata, having eaten your last alms, was totally unbound,’ then Cunda’s remorse should be allayed (in this way): ‘It’s a gain for you, friend Cunda, it’s well-done by you, that the Tathāgata, having eaten your last alms, was totally unbound. Face to face with the Blessed One have I heard it, face to face have I learned it, “These two alms are equal to each other in fruit, equal to each other in result, of much greater fruit & reward than any other alms. Which two? The alms that, after having eaten it, the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled right self-awakening. And the alms that, after having eaten it, the Tathāgata is unbound by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining.5 These are the two alms that are equal to each other in fruit, equal to each other in result, of much greater fruit & reward than any other alms. Venerable6 Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to long life. Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to beauty. Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to happiness. Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to heaven. Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to rank. Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to sovereignty.”’ In this way, Ānanda, Cunda the silversmith’s remorse should be allayed.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                For a person giving,
                merit increases.
                For one self-restraining,
                no animosity is amassed.
                One who is skillful
                leaves evil behind
                and
                –from the ending of
                passion,
                aversion,
                delusion–
                is totally unbound.
              
              
                ",No Introduction,"s
                1. The Commentary notes a wide range of opinions on what “pig-delicacy” means. The opinion given in the Mahā Aṭṭhakathā–the primary source for the Commentary we now have–is that pig-delicacy is tender pork. Other opinions include soft bamboo shoots or mushrooms that pigs like to nibble on, or a special elixir. Given that India has long had a history of giving fanciful names to its foods and elixirs, it’s hard to say for sure what the Buddha ate for his last meal.
                2. This style of narrative–in which prose passages alternate with verses retelling parts of what was narrated in the prose–is called a campū. This sutta is one of the few instances of this type of narrative in the Pali Canon. Another is the Kuṇāla Jātaka (J 5:416-456). There are also some Vedic examples of this form in the Brāhmaṇas, texts that apparently dated from around the same time as the Pali Canon. When the incidents portrayed in this sutta were included in DN 16, these alternating narrative verses were included. Aside from the Buddha’s conversation with Pukkusa the Mallan (see note 4), these are the only incidents that DN 16 narrates in this style. This suggests that perhaps the version of the narrative given here was composed first as a separate piece and then later was incorporated into DN 16.
                3. Ven. Ānanda’s description of the water is alliterative in the Pali: sātodakā sītodakā setodakā.
                4. At this point in the narrative, DN 16 inserts the account of the Buddha’s encounter with Pukkusa the Mallan. There’s no way of knowing which version of the events is earlier, as the focus of this sutta is not on telling everything that happened to the Buddha on his final day, but on recounting all the events related to Cunda’s meal.
                5. Unbinding as experienced by an arahant at death. The image is of a fire so thoroughly out that the embers are totally cold. This is distinguished from the unbinding property with fuel remaining–unbinding as experienced in this lifetime–which is like a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still glowing. See Iti 44, Thag 15:2, and the discussion in The Mind Like Fire Unbound, chapter 1.
                6. Āyasmant: This is a term of respect usually reserved for senior monks. The Buddha’s using it here was probably meant to emphasize the point that Cunda’s gift of the Buddha’s last meal should be treated as a very honorable thing.

Ud 8:6  Pāṭaligāma Sutta | Pāṭali Village,Ud 8:6,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud8_6.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/8:6
              I have heard that on one occasion, while the Blessed One was wandering among the Magadhans with a large community of monks, he arrived at Pāṭali Village. The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard, “The Blessed One, they say, while wandering among the Magadhans with a large community of monks, has reached Pāṭali Village.” So they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to him, “Lord, may the Blessed One acquiesce to (the use of) the rest-house hall.”
              The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Sensing his acquiescence, the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats, bowed down to him, circled him to the right, and then went to the rest-house hall. On arrival, they spread it all over with felt rugs, arranged seats, set out a water vessel, and raised an oil lamp. Then they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, stood to one side. As they were standing there they said to him, “Lord, the rest-house hall has been covered all over with felt rugs, seats have been arranged, a water vessel has been set out, and an oil lamp raised. May the Blessed One do what you think it is now time to do.”
              So the Blessed One, adjusting his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes1–went together with a community of monks to the rest-house hall. On arrival he washed his feet, entered the hall, and sat with his back to the central post, facing east. The community of monks washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with their backs to the western wall, facing east, ranged around the Blessed One.
              The lay followers of Pāṭali Village washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with their backs to the eastern wall, facing west, ranged around the Blessed One.
              Then the Blessed One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭali Village, “Householders, there are these five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue. Which five?
              “There is the case where an unvirtuous person, by reason of heedlessness, undergoes the loss/confiscation of great wealth. This is the first drawback coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue.
              “Furthermore, the bad reputation of the unvirtuous person, failing in virtue, gets spread about. This is the second drawback coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue.
              “Furthermore, whatever assembly the unvirtuous person, failing in virtue, approaches–whether of noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives–he/she does so without confidence & abashed. This is the third drawback coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue.
              “Furthermore, the unvirtuous person, failing in virtue, dies confused. This is the fourth drawback coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue.
              “Furthermore, the unvirtuous person, failing in virtue–on the break-up of the body, after death–reappears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, a hell. This is the fifth drawback coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue.
              “These, householders, are the five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous person’s failure in virtue.
              “Householders, there are these five rewards coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue. Which five?
              “There is the case where a virtuous person, by reason of heedfulness, acquires a great mass of wealth. This is the first reward coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue.
              “Furthermore, the fine reputation of the virtuous person, consummate in virtue, gets spread about. This is the second reward coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue.
               “Furthermore, whatever assembly the virtuous person, consummate in virtue, approaches–whether of noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives–he/she does so with confidence & unabashed. This is the third reward coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue.
               “Furthermore, the virtuous person, consummate in virtue, dies unconfused. This is the fourth reward coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue.
               “Furthermore, the virtuous person, consummate in virtue–on the break-up of the body, after death–reappears in a good destination, a heavenly world. This is the fifth reward coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue.
               “These, householders, are the five rewards coming from a virtuous person’s consummation in virtue.”
              Then the Blessed One–having instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged the lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhamma-talk–dismissed them, saying, “The night is far gone, householders. Do what you think it is now time to do.”
              So the lay followers of Pāṭali Village, delighting in & approving of the Blessed One’s words, got up from their seats, bowed down to him, and left, circling him to the right. Then the Blessed One, not long after they had left, entered an empty building.
              Now, on that occasion, Sunīdha & Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, were building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians. And on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in Pāṭali Village. In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes. In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes. In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes.
              The Blessed One, with the divine eye–purified and surpassing the human–saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village. In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes. In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes. In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes.
              Then, getting up in the last watch of the night, the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ānanda, “Ānanda, who is building a city at Pāṭali Village?”
              “Sunīdha & Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, lord, are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians.”
              “Ānanda, it’s as if they had consulted the Devas of the Thirty-three: That’s how Sunīdha & Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians.
              “Just now, Ānanda–with the divine eye–purified and surpassing the human–I saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village. In the area where devas of great influence occupy sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homes. In the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homes. In the area where devas of low influence occupy sites, there the minds of the king’s royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homes.
              “Ānanda, as far as the sphere of the Ariyans extends, as far as merchants’ roads extend, this will be the supreme city: Pāṭaliputta,2 where the seedpods of the Pāṭali plant break open. There will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta: from fire, from water, and from the breaking of alliances.”
              Then Sunīdha & Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, they said to him, “May Master Gotama acquiesce to our meal today, together with the community of monks.” The Blessed One acquiesced with silence.
              Then Sunīdha & Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha, understanding the Blessed One’s acquiescence, went to their rest-house. On arrival, after having exquisite staple & non-staple food prepared in their rest-house, they announced the time to the Blessed One: “It’s time, Master Gotama. The meal is ready.”
              Then the Blessed One, early in the morning, adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went together with the community of monks to the rest-house of Sunīdha & Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha. On arrival, he sat down on the seat laid out. Sunīdha & Vassakāra, with their own hands, served & satisfied the community of monks, with the Buddha at its head, with exquisite staple & non-staple food. Then, when the Blessed One had finished his meal and rinsed his bowl & hands, Sunīdha & Vassakāra, taking a low seat, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, the Blessed One gave his approval with these verses:
              
                In whatever place
                a wise person makes his dwelling,
                –there providing food
                for the virtuous,
                the restrained,
                leaders of the holy life–
                he should dedicate that offering
                to the devas there.
                
                  They, receiving honor, will honor him;
                  being respected, will show him respect.
                  As a result, they will feel sympathy for him,
                  like that of a mother for her child, her son.
                  A person with whom the devas sympathize
                  always meets with auspicious things.
                
              
              Then the Blessed One, having given his approval to Sunīdha & Vassakāra with these verses, got up from his seat and left. And on that occasion, Sunīdha & Vassakāra followed right after the Blessed One, (thinking,) “By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative departs today, that will be called the Gotama Gate. And by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River, that will be called the Gotama Ford.”
              So the gate by which the Blessed One departed was called the Gotama Gate. Then he went to the Ganges River. Now on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks, so that a crow could drink from it. Some people were searching for boats, some were searching for floats, some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other. So the Blessed One–just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm–disappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the community of monks. He saw that some people were searching for boats, some were searching for floats, some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other.
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                Those
                who cross the foaming flood,
                having made a bridge, avoiding the swamps
                –while people are binding rafts–
                have already crossed
                : the wise.

                1. The translation here follows the Burmese and Sri Lankan editions of the text. The PTS and Thai editions state that the Buddha went to the rest-house hall in the morning–which, given the events that follow, doesn’t seem right, for he would have spent the entire day teaching the lay followers of Pāṭali Village. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions of the account of these events given in DN 16 state explicitly that the Buddha went to the rest-house hall in the late afternoon, which seems more reasonable. The PTS edition of that passage doesn’t state the time of day, while the Thai edition states that he went in the morning.
                2. Pāṭaliputta later became the capital of King Asoka’s empire. The “breaking open of the seed-pods (pūṭa-bhedana)” is a wordplay on the last part of the city’s name.
                Archaeological evidence from what may have been part of Asoka’s palace in Pāṭaliputta shows burnt wooden posts buried in mud–perhaps a sign that the palace burned and then was buried in a flood.

Ud 8:7  Dvidhapatha Sutta | A Fork in the Path,Ud 8:7,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud8_7.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/8:7
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was journeying along a road in the Kosalan country with Ven. Nāgasamāla as his junior companion. Ven. Nāgasamāla, while going along the road, saw a fork in the path. On seeing it, he said to the Blessed One, “That, lord Blessed One,1 is the route. We go that way.” When this was said, the Blessed One said, “This, Nāgasamāla, is the route. We go this way.”
              A second time… A third time, Ven. Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One, “That, lord Blessed One, is the route. We go that way.” And for a third time, the Blessed One said, “This, Nāgasamāla, is the route. We go this way.”
              Then Ven. Nāgasamāla, placing the Blessed One’s bowl & robes right there on the ground, left, saying, “This, lord Blessed One, is the bowl & robes.”
              Then as Ven. Nāgasamāla was going along that route, thieves–jumping out in the middle of the road–pummeled him with their fists & feet, broke his bowl, and ripped his outer robe to shreds.
              So Ven. Nāgasamāla–with his bowl broken, his outer robe ripped to shreds–went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Just now, lord, as I was going along that route, thieves jumped out in the middle of the road, pummeled me with their fists & feet, broke my bowl, and ripped my outer robe to shreds.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                When traveling together,
                mixed together
                with a person who doesn’t know,
                an attainer-of-wisdom,
                on realizing that the person is evil,
                abandons him
                as a milk-feeding2 heron,
                a bog.
              
              
                ",No Introduction,"s
                1. Throughout the first part of this story, Ven. Nāgasamāla refers to the Buddha with this exaggerated form of address. Perhaps the compilers meant this as a linguistic hint of how inappropriate an attendant he was for the Buddha. (Suppavāsā uses it in Ud 2:8, but there it is appropriate as she is overcome with joy.) At the point in the present narrative where Ven. Nāgasamāla puts the Buddha’s bowl and robes on the ground, the Sri Lankan and Burmese editions correct his statement to the more appropriate: “This, lord, is the Blessed One’s bowl & robes.” However, to be in keeping with his normal way of addressing the Buddha, and to stress the rudeness of the gesture, I felt it better to keep the sentence as it is in the Thai edition. Only after Ven. Nāgasamāla is chastened by his experience with the thieves does he revert to the using the simpler and more standard address: “lord.”
                2. Milk-feeding = khīrapaka. This is a poetic way of saying “young and unweaned”–the “milk” here being the regurgitated food with which the mother heron feeds her young. Also–in the conventions of Indian literature–the reference to milk suggests that the heron is white. The Commentary has a fanciful way of explaining this term, saying that it refers to a special type of heron so sensitive that, when fed milk mixed with water, it drinks just the milk.

Ud 8:8  Visākhā Sutta | Visākhā,Ud 8:8,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud8_8.html,No Summary,"KN/Ud/8:8
              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra’s mother. And on that occasion a dear and beloved grandson of Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, had died. So Visākhā, Migāra’s mother–her clothes wet, her hair wet–went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her: “Why have you come here, Visākhā–your clothes wet, your hair wet–in the middle of the day?”
              When this was said, she said to the Blessed One, “My dear and beloved grandson has died. This is why I have come here–my clothes wet, my hair wet–in the middle of the day.”
              “Visākhā, would you like to have as many children & grandchildren as there are people in Sāvatthī?”
              “Yes, lord, I would like to have as many children & grandchildren as there are people in Sāvatthī.”
              “But how many people in Sāvatthī die in the course of a day?”
              “Sometimes ten people die in Sāvatthī in the course of a day, sometimes nine… eight… seven… six… five… four… three… two… Sometimes one person dies in Sāvatthī in the course of a day. Sāvatthī is never free from people dying.”
              “So what do you think, Visākhā? Would you ever be free of wet clothes & wet hair?”
              “No, lord. Enough of my having so many children & grandchildren.”
              “Visākhā, those who have a hundred dear ones have a hundred sufferings. Those who have ninety dear ones have ninety sufferings. Those who have eighty… seventy… sixty… fifty… forty… thirty… twenty… ten… nine… eight… seven… six… five… four… three… two… Those who have one dear one have one suffering. Those who have no dear ones have no sufferings. They are free from sorrow, free from stain, free from lamentation, I tell you.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                The sorrows, lamentations,
                the many kinds of suffering in the world,
                exist dependent on something dear.
                They don’t exist
                when there’s nothing dear.
                And thus blissful & sorrowless
                are those for whom nothing
                in the world is anywhere dear.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Ven. Dabba Mallaputta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, “Now is the time for my total unbinding, O One-Well-Gone!”
              “Then do, Dabba, what you think it is now time to do.”
              Then Ven. Dabba Mallaputta, rising from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One and, circling him on the right, rose up into the air and sat cross-legged in the sky, in space. Entering & emerging from the fire property, he was totally unbound. Now, when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, in space, entered & emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound, his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned. Just as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed, neither ashes nor soot can be discerned, in the same way, when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, in space, entered & emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound, his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned.

              I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There he addressed the monks, “Monks!”
              “Yes, lord,” the monks responded to him.
              The Blessed One said, “When Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, in space, entered & emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound, his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned. Just as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed, neither ashes nor soot can be discerned, in the same way, when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, in space, entered & emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound, his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned.”
              Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
              
                Just as the destination of a glowing fire
                struck with a [blacksmith’s] iron hammer,

                Even so, there’s no destination to describe

                –having crossed over the flood
                of sensuality’s bond–

                unwavering bliss.

MN 2 lists the following questions as not fit for attention: “Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? … Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? … Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?” The discourse also lists the following issues as fit for attention: “This is stress. This is the origination of stress. This is the cessation of stress. This is the way leading to the cessation of stress.” Other passages show that appropriate attention views experience not only in terms of the four noble truths, but also in terms of the duties appropriate to those truths.

I directly know that, having long performed meritorious deeds, I long experienced desirable, pleasing, endearing, charming results. Having developed a mind of good will for seven years, then for seven eons of contraction & expansion I didn’t return to this world. Whenever the eon was contracting, I entered the [realm of] Radiance. Whenever the eon was expanding, I reappeared in an empty Brahma-abode. There I was Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Unconquered Conqueror, Total Seer, Wielder of Power. Then for thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the gods. For many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning emperor, a righteous king of Dhamma, conqueror of the four corners of the earth, maintaining stable control over the countryside, endowed with the seven treasures1 –to say nothing of the times I was a local king. The thought occurred to me, ‘Of what action of mine is this the fruit, of what action the result, that I now have such great power & might?’ Then the thought occurred to me, ‘This is the fruit of my three [types of] action, the result of three types of action, that I now have such great power & might: i.e., generosity, self-control, & restraint.’”

Some scholars have argued that the term “unborn” cannot be used to distinguish Unbinding from transmigration, as there are discourses (such as SN 15:3) stating that transmigration itself has no beginning point, implying that it too is unborn. Thus they argue that in this passage the term ajātaṁ, although a past participle, should be translated as, “without birth.” However, this argument is based on two questionable premises. First, it assumes that Unbinding is here being contrasted with transmigration, even though the passage simply contrasts it with the fabricated. Secondly, even assuming that the phrase “the born—the become,” etc., is a reference to transmigration, the scholars’ argument is based on a misreading of SN 15:3. There, transmigration is said to have an “inconceivable” or “undiscoverable” beginning point. This is very different from saying that it is unborn. If transmigration were unborn, it would be unfabricated (see AN 3:47), which is obviously not the case. Thus, in translating this term to describe Unbinding, I have maintained the straight grammatical reading, “unborn.”",No Additional

In the second, the fire is so thoroughly out that the embers have grown cold. The “fuel” here is the five aggregates (see the Glossary). While the Arahant is still alive, he/she still experiences the five aggregates, but they do not burn with the fires of passion, aversion, or delusion. When the Arahant passes away, there is no longer any experience of aggregates here or anywhere else. For a discussion of this point, see The Mind Like Fire Unbound, pp. 21-37.

One who, not living the celibate life, pretends to be one who lives the celibate life; and one who groundlessly accuses one who lives the celibate life perfectly & purely of uncelibate behavior. These are the two who are doomed to deprivation, to hell, for not abandoning their conduct.”

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: “Overcome by two viewpoints, monks, some human & divine beings adhere, other human & divine beings slip right past, while those with vision see.
            “And how do some adhere? Human & divine beings enjoy becoming, delight in becoming, are satisfied with becoming. When the Dhamma is being taught for the sake of the cessation of becoming, their minds do not take to it, are not calmed by it, do not settle on it or become resolved on it. This is how some adhere.
            “And how do some slip right past? Some, feeling horrified, humiliated, & disgusted with that very becoming, relish non-becoming: ‘When this self, at the break-up of the body, after death, perishes & is destroyed, and does not exist after death, that is peaceful, that is exquisite, that is sufficiency!’ This is how some slip right past.
            “And how do those with vision see? There is the case where a monk sees what’s come to be as what’s come to be. Seeing what’s come to be as what’s come to be, he practices for disenchantment with what’s come to be, dispassion toward what’s come to be, cessation of what’s come to be. This is how those with vision see.”1

SN 12:15 presents the same point from a different perspective: “This world takes as its object a polarity, that of existence & non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world [= the six senses and their objects] as it has come to be with right discernment, ‘non-existence’ with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it has come to be with right discernment, ‘existence’ with reference to the world does not occur to one. By & large, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings, & biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on ‘my self.’ He has no uncertainty or doubt that mere stress, when arising, is arising; stress, when passing away, is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others. It’s to this extent, Kaccāna, that there is right view.”

              1. According to the Commentary, the first of these faculties corresponds to the first noble attainment, the path to stream-entry; the second, to the next six attainments, ranging from the fruition of stream-entry to the path to Arahantship; and the third, to the highest attainment, the fruition of Arahantship. The prose portion of this itivuttaka is repeated at AN 3:86, and §102.
              2. Such (tādin): see the note to §44.
              3. Akuppā. This term is sometimes translated as “unshakable,” but it literally means, “unprovoked.” The reference is apparently to the theory of dhātu, or properties underlying physical or psychological events in nature. The physical properties according to this theory are four: earth (solidity), liquid, heat, and wind (motion). Three of them–liquid, heat, & wind–are potentially active. When they are aggravated, agitated, or provoked–the Pali term here, pakuppati, is used also on the psychological level, where it means angered or upset–they act as the underlying cause for natural activity. When the provocation ends, the corresponding activity subsides.
              Although §44 lists two nibbāna properties, these two properties are distinctive in that the experience of nibbāna is not caused by their provocation.

                should not be comrades

                in a blade of kusa grass
                makes the grass smelly:
                so it is
                if you seek out fools.
                But a man who wraps powdered incense
                in the leaf of a tree

                So,
                knowing your own outcome
                as like the leaf-wrapper’s,
                you shouldn’t seek out
                those who aren’t good.

Having gone to a good destination, gain the gain that is good to gain. Having gained the gain that is good to gain, become well-established.’”

            “The human state, monks,1 is the devas’ reckoning of going to a good destination. Having become a human being, acquiring conviction in the Dhamma-&-Vinaya taught by the Tathāgata: this is the devas’ reckoning of the gain that is good to gain.

              “And how is consciousness said not to be externally scattered & diffused? There is the case where, having seen a form with the eye, consciousness does not follow the drift of the theme of the form, is not tied to… chained to… fettered, or joined to the attraction of the theme of the form. Consciousness is said not to be externally scattered & diffused. [Similarly with the other senses.] …
              “And how is the mind said not to be internally positioned? There is the case where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters & remains in the first jhāna: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. His consciousness does not follow the drift of the rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, is not tied to… chained to… fettered, or joined to the attraction of the rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. [Similarly with the second, third, and fourth jhānas.] The mind is said not to be internally positioned.”
              “And how is non-agitation caused by lack of clinging/sustenance? There is the case where an instructed disciple of the noble ones–who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed & disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for people of integrity, is well-versed & disciplined in their Dhamma–doesn’t assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form. His form changes & is unstable, but his consciousness doesn’t–because of the change & instability of form–alter in accordance with the change in form. His mind is not consumed with any agitation born from an alteration in accordance with the change in form or coming from the co-arising of [unskillful mental] qualities. And because his awareness is not consumed, he feels neither fearful, threatened, nor solicitous. [Similarly with the aggregates of feeling, perception, fabrications, and consciousness.] “This, friends, is how non-agitation is caused by lack of clinging/sustenance.”

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: “It’s with reference to Dhamma, monks, that I describe [a person as] a brahman with threefold knowledge, and not another as measured by citing & reciting. And how is it with reference to Dhamma that I describe [a person as] a brahman with threefold knowledge, and not another as measured by citing & reciting?
            “There is the case where a monk recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two… five, ten… fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion: ‘There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance.

There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my sensitivity to pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.’ Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes & details.
            “This is the first knowledge he has attained. Ignorance has been destroyed; knowledge has arisen; darkness has been destroyed; light has arisen–as happens in one who remains heedful, ardent, & resolute.
            “Then again, the monk sees–by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human–beings passing away & re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their actions: ‘These beings–who were endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, & mental misconduct; who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. But these beings–who were endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, & mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.’ Thus–by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human–he sees beings passing away & re-appearing, and discerns how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their actions.
            “This is the second knowledge he has attained. Ignorance has been destroyed; knowledge has arisen; darkness has been destroyed; light has arisen–as happens in one who remains heedful, ardent, & resolute.

And you, monks, are very helpful to brahmans & householders, as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; as you expound the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely complete, surpassingly pure. In this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence, for the purpose of crossing over the flood, for making a right end to stress.”

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: “Monks, suppose a man were being carried along by the flow of a river, lovely & alluring. And then another man with good eyesight, standing on the bank, on seeing him would say, ‘My good man, even though you are being carried along by the flow of a river, lovely & alluring, further down from here is a pool with waves & whirlpools, with seizers & demons. On reaching that pool you will suffer death or death-like pain.’ Then the first man, on hearing the words of the second man, would make an effort with his hands & feet to go against the flow.
            “I have given you this simile to illustrate a meaning. The meaning is this: the flow of the river stands for craving. Lovely & alluring stands for the six internal sense-media. The pool further down stands for the five lower fetters.1 The waves stand for anger & distress. The whirlpools stand for the five strings of sensuality. The seizers & demons stand for the opposite sex. Against the flow stands for renunciation. Making an effort with hands & feet stands for the arousing of persistence. The man with good eyesight standing on the bank stands for the Tathāgata, worthy & rightly self-awakened.”
            
              Even if it’s with pain,

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: “Monks, the world1 has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. From the world, the Tathāgata is disjoined. The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. The origination of the world has, by the Tathāgata, been abandoned. The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. The cessation of the world has, by the Tathāgata, been realized. The path leading to the cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. The path leading to the cessation of the world has, by the Tathāgata, been developed.2
            “Whatever in this world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect, that has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.
            “From the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Self-awakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining,3 whatever the Tathāgata has said, spoken, explained is just so (tatha) and not otherwise. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.
            “The Tathāgata is one who does in line with (tathā) what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does. Because he is one who does in line with what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does, he is thus called the Tathāgata.
            “In this world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmas, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & common people, the Tathāgata is the unconquered conqueror, total seer, the wielder of power.4 Thus he is called the Tathāgata.”
            This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:
            
              Directly knowing all the world,
              all the world as it really is,
              from all the world disjoined,
              in all the world unmatched.
              Conquering all
              in all ways,
              enlightened,
              released from all bonds,
              he touches the foremost peace–
              Unbinding, free
              from fear.
              
                He is free
                of effluent,
                of trouble,
                awakened,
                his doubts cut through;
                has attained the ending of action,
                is released in the destruction of acquisitions.
                He is blessed, awakened.
                He is a lion, unsurpassed.
                In the world with its devas
                he set the Brahma-wheel going.5

                who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,
                gathering, pay homage

                ‘Tamed, he’s the best
                of those who can be tamed;
                calm, the seer
                of those who can be calmed;
                released, supreme
                among those who can be released;
                crossed, the foremost
                of those who can cross.’
              
              
                Thus they pay homage

                there’s no one
                to compare
                with you.’

              1. SN 35:82 defines the “world“ as the six sense spheres, their objects, consciousness at those spheres, contact at those spheres, and whatever arises in dependence on that contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither pleasure nor pain.
              2. This passage parallels, with one change, the duties appropriate to the four nobles truths: abandoning the origination of stress, realizing its cessation, and developing the path of practice leading to its cessation. The one deviation is that whereas the duty with regard to stress is to comprehend it, here the Tathāgata is disjoined from the world. See SN 56:11.
              3. See §44.
              4. These are epithets usually associated with the Great Brahma. See §22.
              5. The Brahma-wheel = the Dhamma-wheel, the name of the Buddha’s first sermon, so called because it contains a “wheel” that lists all twelve combinations of two variables: the four noble truths–stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation–and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed. This wheel constitutes the Buddha’s most central teaching.

                The monk in whom
                there’s nothing born of disturbance5

                The monk in whom
                there’s nothing born of the underbrush6

                for binding him to becoming,

                The monk who’s abandoned five hindrances,
                who, untroubled, de-arrowed,7
                has crossed over doubt,
                sloughs off the near shore & far—
                as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

This suggests that the verses originally may have been separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because they share the same refrain.

              1. Dhaniya Gopa: literally, One Whose Wealth is in Cattle. According to SnA, his herd consisted of 30,000 head of cattle.
              2. The first line in the Buddha’s verse plays on words in the first line of Dhaniya’s. “Free from anger” (akkodhano) plays on “rice is cooked” (pakkodano); and “rigidity” (khilo) plays on “milk” (khīro).
              3. “Open” means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is also used at Ud 5:5 and Sn 4:4. “My fire out” refers to the fires of passion, aversion, & delusion; birth, aging, & death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair. See SN 35:28; Iti 93; and The Mind Like Fire Unbound.
              4. The raft stands for the noble eightfold path. See MN 22 and SN 35:197.
              5. As this verse doesn’t seem to be a direct response to the preceding one, SnA suggests that we are missing part of the conversation here. An alternative possibility is that the Buddha is engaging in word play—the word “crossed over” (tiṇṇa) being a pun on Dhaniya’s reference to grass (tiṇa).
              6. According to SnA, the Buddha is not in anyone else’s employ nor even in his own employ—i.e., he is not in the employ of craving.
              7. The Buddha may be speaking literally here—he has no cattle, so there is no way that a heavy rain could cause him harm—but he may also be speaking metaphorically. See SN 4:19 and Thag 1:1.
              8. See MN 66.
              9. This verse is quoted in the Milinda Pañhā.
              10. On the theme of the Buddha as “One with Eyes,” see DN 16, note 44.",", Sn 2:12, note 2.
              11. According to SnA, Māra suddenly comes on the scene to try—unsuccessfully—to prevent Dhaniya and his wife from going forth. His verses here, together with the Buddha’s response, are also found at SN 4:8.

              like a rhinoceros.
              
                For a person by nature entangled
                there are affections;
                on the heels of affection, this pain.
                Seeing the drawback born of affection,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                One whose mind
                is enmeshed in sympathy
                for friends & companions,
                neglects the goal.

                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Like spreading bamboo,
                entwined,
                is concern for offspring & spouses.
                Like a bamboo sprout,
                unentangling,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.

                unfettered,2
                goes for forage wherever it wants:
                The observant person, valuing freedom,
                wanders alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                In the midst of companions
                —when staying at home,
                when going out wandering—
                you are prey to requests.
                Valuing the freedom
                that no one else covets,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                There is sporting & love
                in the midst of companions,
                & abundant love for offspring.
                Feeling disgust
                at the prospect of parting
                from those who’d be dear,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Without resistance in all four directions,
                content with whatever you get,
                enduring troubles without panic,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                They are hard to please,
                some of those gone forth,
                as well as those living the household life.
                Being unconcerned
                with the offspring of others,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Cutting off the householder’s marks,3

                  If you gain an astute companion,
                  a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened,
                  overcoming all troubles,

                  [his herd].4
                
              
              
                We praise companionship
                —yes!
                Those on a par, or better,
                should be chosen as friends.
                If they’re not to be found,
                living faultlessly,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Seeing radiant bracelets of gold,
                well-made by a smith,
                clinking, clashing,
                two on an arm,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros,
              
              
                [Thinking:]
                “In the same way,
                if I were to live with another,
                there would be conversation or attachment.”
                Seeing this future danger,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Because sensual pleasures,
                elegant, honeyed, & charming,
                bewitch the mind with their manifold forms—
                seeing this drawback in sensual strings5—
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                “Calamity, tumor, misfortune,
                disease, an arrow, a danger for me.”
                Seeing this danger in sensual strings,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Cold & heat, hunger & thirst,
                wind & sun, horseflies & snakes:
                Enduring all these, without exception,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                As a great white elephant,
                with massive shoulders,
                renouncing his herd,
                lives in the wilds wherever he wants,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                “There’s no way

                With no greed, no deceit,
                no thirst, no hypocrisy—
                delusion & blemishes
                blown away—
                with no inclinations for all the world,
                every world,
                wander alone

                Avoid the evil companion
                disregarding the goal,
                intent on the discordant9 way.

                who maintains the Dhamma,
                a great & quick-witted friend.
                Knowing the meanings,
                subdue your perplexity,
                [then] wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Free from longing, finding no pleasure
                in the world’s sport, ardor, or sensual bliss,
                abstaining from adornment,
                speaking the truth,
                wander alone

                father, mother,
                riches, grain, relatives,
                & sensual pleasures
                altogether,
                wander alone

                “This is a bondage.
                There’s little happiness here,
                next to no enjoyment,
                all the more suffering & pain.10

                Showing no greed for flavors, not wanton,
                going from house to house for alms
                with mind unenmeshed in this family or that,
                wander alone

                Turning your back on pleasure & pain,
                as earlier with sorrow & joy,
                attaining pure

                With persistence aroused
                for the highest goal’s attainment,
                with mind unsmeared, not lazy in action,
                firm in effort, with steadfastness & strength arisen,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Not neglecting seclusion, jhāna,
                constantly living the Dhamma
                in line with the Dhamma,
                comprehending the danger
                in states of becoming,

                but learned, mindful,
                —having reckoned the Dhamma—
                certain & striving,
                wander alone

                Unstartled,     like a lion at sounds.
                Unsnared,     like the wind in a net.
                Unsmeared,     like a lotus in water15:
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                Like a lion—forceful, strong in fang,
                living as a conqueror, the king of beasts—
                resort to a solitary dwelling.
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                At the right time consorting
                with the release through goodwill,
                compassion,
                empathetic joy,
                equanimity,
                unobstructed by all the world,
                any world,

                aversion,
                delusion;
                having shattered     the fetters;
                unfazed     at the ending of life,
                wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
              
                People follow & associate
                for a motive.
                Friends without a motive these days
                are rare.
                They’re shrewd for their own ends, & impure.
                Wander alone
                like a rhinoceros.
              
            
            vv. 35–75","The refrain in this sutta is a subject of controversy. The text literally says, “Wander alone like a ‘sword-horn,’ which is the Pali term for rhinoceros. SnA, however, insists that this refers not to the animal but to its horn, because the Indian rhinoceros, unlike the African, has only one horn. Still, some scholars have noted that while the Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal, rhinoceros horns don’t wander, and that in other verses in the Pali Canon, the phrase “wander alone like…” takes a person or an animal, not an animal part, for its object. Thus, for example, in Dhp 329 (repeated below), one is told to “wander alone like a king renouncing his kingdom, like the elephant in the Mataṅga woods, his herd.” It’s possible that the rhinoceros was chosen here as an example of solitary wandering both because of its habits and because of its unusual single horn. However, in a translation, it’s necessary to choose one reading over the other. Thus, because wandering ”like a rhinoceros” sounds more natural than wandering “like a horn,” I have chosen the former rendering. Keep in mind, though, that the singularity of the rhinoceros horn reinforces the image.
            Other versions of this poem exist in Sanskrit: a short Sanskrit version in the Mahāvastu, and a Gāndhārī version in a manuscript discovered in Central Asia. The Gāndhārī version contains many of the same verses given here, but in a different order. The Mahāvastu version contains only 12 verses, but it is followed by a statement that the full version of the sutta contained 500 verses. How that number was achieved is suggested by the fact that, of the 12 verses, several contain only minor variations from one another. All of this suggests that the verses here originally may have been separate poems, composed on separate occasions, and that they were gathered together because of their common refrain.
            Like the Pārānaya Vagga, this poem is given a detailed interpretation in Nd II. Nd II ends its discussion of this sutta by saying that it was spoken by a Private Buddha, i.e., one who gains awakening on his own but is unable to formulate the Dhamma in such a way as to teach others to gain awakening. This assertion, however, is contradicted by the content of some of the verses, such as the one beginning, “Consort with one who is learned, who maintains the Dhamma, a great & quick-witted friend.” Such a friend would not have existed in the time of a Private Buddha.
            There is evidence suggesting that in the centuries after the rule of King Asoka, monastery-dwelling monks began to look askance at forest-dwelling monks, and in some cases even forbade them from entering the precincts around the stupas of their monasteries. Because Nd I and Nd II were most likely composed by monastery-dwelling monks, it might be the case that they tried to blunt the message of this sutta by attributing it to a Private Buddha rather than to our Buddha, the implication being that its advice was not appropriate for monks of their day and age.

              1. Nd II details the various ways in which a Private Buddha can be said to wander alone (eko). Two of the ways have to do with physical seclusion: He goes forth alone and wanders without a companion. The remaining have to do with mental seclusion: He has abandoned craving; is free of passion, aversion, and delusion; and has followed the path going one way only (ekāyanamagga). Interestingly enough, Nd II defines this path, not as just the four establishings of mindfulness (see DN 22) but as all seven sets of dhammas in the Wings to Awakening.
              Nd II illustrates its reference to the abandoning of craving as a type of seclusion with this verse from Iti 15:
              
                With craving his companion, a man
                wanders on a long, long time.
                Neither in this state here
                nor anywhere else
                does he go beyond
                the wandering-on.
                Knowing this drawback—
                that craving brings stress into play—
                free          from craving,
                devoid     of clinging,
                mindful,     the monk
                lives the mendicant life. 
              
              Nd II illustrates its reference to the path going one way only with this verse from SN 47:18 and SN 47:43:
              
                One with vision of the ending of birth,
                sympathetic to welfare,
                discerns the path going one way only,
                by which, in the past, they crossed over,
                are now crossing over,
                and will cross over
                the flood.
              
              2. SN 35:191 lists two fetters: desire and passion. AN 10:13 lists ten: self-identification views, uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices, sensual desire, ill will, passion for form, passion for what is formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. 
              3. Hair and beard.
              4. These verses = Dhp 328–329.
              5. “There are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire; sounds cognizable via the ear… aromas cognizable via the nose… flavors cognizable via the tongue… tactile sensations cognizable via the body—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire. But these are not sensuality. They are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones.” — AN 6:63
              6. The temporary release from such things as the hindrances, attained when entering right concentration, or the temporary release from some of the factors of lower states of jhāna, attained when entering higher states of jhāna. This release lasts only as long as the necessary causal factors are still in place. This is apparently the same thing as the occasional release/liberation mentioned in MN 29. See note 2 to that sutta.
              7. An epithet for the Buddha.
              8. According to Nd II, the views here are the 20 forms of identity-views (see SN 22:1) and the 62 views discussed in DN 1. (The connection between these two lists is discussed in SN 41:3.) MN 2, however, explains a “contortion of views” in different terms, which may have been intended here.
              9. Visama. See Sn 1:12, note 11.
              10. See MN 54.
              11. Reading gaṇḍo with the Thai editions. The other editions have gaḷo, fishhook. See AN 9:15.
              12. Nd II explains “not soggy” by quoting Ven. Mahā Moggallāna’s words in SN 35:202. The central part of the passage is this: “And how is one soggy? There is the case where a monk, when seeing a form via the eye, is, in the case of pleasing forms, committed to forms and, in the case of displeasing forms, afflicted by forms. He remains with body-mindfulness not present, and with limited awareness. And he does not discern, as it has come to be, the awareness-release & discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace. [Similarly with the remaining sense media.] … 
              “And how is one not soggy? There is the case where a monk, when seeing a form via the eye, is not, in the case of pleasing forms, committed to forms nor, in the case of displeasing forms, afflicted by forms. He remains with body-mindfulness present, and with immeasurable awareness. And he discerns, as it has come to be, the awareness-release & discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace. [Similarly with the remaining sense media.]”","AN 3:110.
              According to Nd II, “not burning” means not burning with the fires of passion, aversion, and delusion. See SN 35:28 and Iti 93.
              13. Lay clothing.
              14. This is a reference to the fourth jhāna. See MN 119.
              15. These lines are repeated at Sn 1:12.

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans in Dakkhiṇāgiri near the brahman village of Ekanāḷā. Now at that time approximately 500 of the brahman Kasi [Plowing] Bhāradvāja’s plows were yoked at the sowing time. Then, in the early morning, after adjusting his lower robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, the Blessed One went to where Kasi Bhāradvāja was working. Now at that time Kasi Bhāradvāja’s food-distribution was underway. So the Blessed One went to Kasi Bhāradvāja’s food-distribution and, on arrival, stood to one side. Kasi Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One standing for alms, and on seeing him, said to him, “I, contemplative, plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, I eat. You, too, contemplative, should plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, you (will) eat.”
            “I, too, brahman, plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, I eat.”
            “But, contemplative, we don’t see the Master Gotama’s yoke or plow, plowshare, goad, or oxen, and yet the Master Gotama says this: ‘I, too, brahman, plow & sow. Having plowed & sown, I eat.’”
            Then Kasi Bhāradvāja addressed the Blessed One with a verse:
            
              You claim to be a plowman,
              but we don’t see your plowing.
              Being asked, tell us about your plowing
              so that we may know your plowing.
              
                The Buddha:
                Conviction’s     my seed,
                austerity     my rain,
                discernment     my yoke & plow,
                shame     my pole,
                mind     my yoke-tie,
                mindfulness     my plowshare & goad.
              
              
                Guarded in body,
                guarded in speech,
                restrained in terms of belly & food,
                I make truth a weeding-hook,
                and composure my unyoking.
                Persistence, my beast of burden,
                bearing me toward rest from the yoke,
                takes me, without turning back,
                to where, having gone,
                one doesn’t grieve.
                That’s how my plowing is plowed.
                It has
                as its fruit
                the deathless.
                Having plowed this plowing,
                one is unyoked
                from all suffering
                & stress.
              
            
            Then Kasi Bhāradvāja, having heaped up milk-rice in a large bronze serving bowl, offered it to the Blessed One, [saying,] “May Master Gotama eat [this] milk-rice. The master is a plowman, for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless.”
            
              The Buddha:
              What’s been chanted over with verses
              shouldn’t be eaten by me.
              That’s not the nature, brahman,
              of one who’s seen rightly.
              What’s been chanted over with verses
              Awakened Ones reject.
              That being their Dhamma, brahman,
              this is their way of life.
              Serve with other food & drink
              a fully-perfected great seer,
              his effluents     ended,
              his anxiety     stilled,
              for that is the field
              for one looking for merit.
            
            “Then to whom, Master Gotama, should I give this milk-rice?”
            “Brahman, I don’t see that person in this world—with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk—by whom this milk-rice, having been eaten, would be rightly digested, aside from a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata’s disciple. In that case, brahman, throw the milk-rice away in a place without vegetation, or dump it in water with no living beings.”
            So Kasi Bhāradvāja dumped the milk-rice in water with no living beings. And the milk-rice, when dropped in the water, hissed & sizzled, seethed & steamed. Just as an iron ball heated all day, when tossed in the water, hisses & sizzles, seethes & steams, in the same way the milk-rice, when dropped in the water, hissed & sizzled, seethed & steamed.
            Then Kasi Bhāradvāja—in awe, his hair standing on end—went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, said to him, “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life. Let me obtain the Going-forth in Master Gotama’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance (into the Bhikkhu Saṅgha).”
            Then the brahman Kasi Bhāradvāja obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Bhāradvāja became another one of the arahants.

              1. A corrupter of families is a monk who ingratiates himself into a family’s affections by performing services for them that are inappropriate for a monk to do, thus diverting their faith away from those who live by the Dhamma and Vinaya. For more on this term, see The Buddhist Monastic Code, Saṅghādisesa 13.

            I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she addressed him with a verse:
            
              About the man in decline
              we ask Gotama,
              having come to question the Blessed One:
              What is the way leading to decline?
              
                The Buddha:
                Easily known     is the one of good prospects;
                easily known,1     the one in decline.
                The one of good prospects
                loves the Dhamma,
                the one in decline
                detests it.
              
              
                The deva:
                We know, indeed, that that is so.
                That’s the first one in decline.
                May the Blessed One tell the second:
                What is the way leading to decline?
              
              
                The Buddha:
                The wicked are dear to him,
                the good he doesn’t hold dear.
                He approves of the ideas of the wicked:
                That is the way leading to decline.
              
              
                The deva:
                We know, indeed, that that is so.
                That’s the second one in decline.
                May the Blessed One tell the third:
                What is the way leading to decline?
              
              
                The Buddha:
                Prone to sleep, prone to company,
                the man with no initiative,
                lazy & known for his anger:
                That is the way leading to decline.
              
              
                The deva:
                We know, indeed, that that is so.
                That’s the third one in decline.
                May the Blessed One tell the fourth:
                What is the way leading to decline?
              
              
                The Buddha:
                Though capable, one doesn’t support
                one’s mother or father
                —old, their youth over & done:
                That is the way leading to decline.

                Whoever deceives with a lie
                a brahman, contemplative,
                or other mendicant:
                That is the way leading to decline.

                with gold & food,
                enjoys his luxuries alone:

                proud of his wealth,
                proud of his clan,
                despises his own relatives:
                That is the way leading to decline.

                debauched in drink,
                debauched in gambling,

                His youth past,
                a man takes a young woman
                with timbara-fruit breasts,
                and, jealous of her, doesn’t sleep:
                That is the way leading to decline.

Sn 1:7  An Outcaste,Sn 1:7,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp1_7.html,"Sn 1:7  An Outcaste  —  Being an outcaste is a matter of behavior, not birth.","KN/Sn/1:7
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, in the early morning, after adjusting his lower robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, he entered Sāvatthī for alms. Now at that time, in the house of the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja, a (sacrificial) fire was burning and an offering was lifted up. Then the Blessed One, going through Sāvatthī on a methodical almsround,1 approached the house of Aggika Bhāradvāja. Aggika Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, on seeing him, said to him: “Stop right there, you little shaveling! Right there, you little contemplative! Right there, you little outcaste!”
            When this was said, the Blessed One said to the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja, “But do you know, brahman, what an outcaste is, or the actions that make one an outcaste?”
            “No, in fact, Master Gotama, I don’t know what an outcaste is, or the actions that make one an outcaste. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I would know what an outcaste is and the actions that make one an outcaste.”
            “In that case, brahman, listen and pay close attention. I will speak.”
            “As you say, master,” the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja responded to the Blessed One.
            The Blessed One said:
            
              Whatever man is angry, resentful,
              evil, merciless,
              deceitful, and defective in his views:
              He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
                Whoever here harms a living being
                once-born or twice-born,2
                who has no sympathy for a living being:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever destroys or besieges
                villages or towns,
                a notorious oppressor:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, from village or wilderness,
                takes in a manner of theft
                what others claim as ‘mine’:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, actually incurring a debt,
                when pressed to pay, evades,
                (saying,) ‘I’m in no debt to you’:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, desiring whatever-the-thing,
                strikes a person going along a road,
                to take whatever-the-thing:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whatever man, for his own sake,
                the sake of another,
                or the sake of wealth,
                tells a lie when asked to bear witness:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever misbehaves

                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’

                his mother or father
                —old, their youth over & done:

                and reviles with his speech

                sister or brother,
                or mother-in-law:

                Whoever, asked about what’s beneficial,
                teaches what’s not
                and gives counsel concealing some points:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, doing an evil deed,
                wishes, ‘May I not be known,’
                acting in hiding:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, having gone to another’s house,
                being offered pure food,
                doesn’t honor (the host) in return
                when he comes (to one’s house):
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever deceives with a lie
                a brahman, contemplative,
                or other mendicant:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, when a brahman or contemplative
                appears at mealtime,
                reviles him with speech and doesn’t give:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’3
              
              
                Whoever, wrapped in delusion,
                speaks here what is untrue,

                Angry, mean, evil in his desires,
                miserly, dishonest,
                devoid of shame & compunction:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever heaps verbal abuse
                on an Awakened One
                or his disciple,
                wanderer or householder:
                He should be known as ‘outcaste.’
              
              
                Whoever, though not an arahant,
                claims to be an arahant:
                He is the thief in this world with its Brahmās.5
                He is the vilest of outcastes.
              
              
                These are said to be outcastes,
                as I have proclaimed them to you.
                Not by birth is one an outcaste,
                not by birth a brahman.
                By action one is an outcaste.
                By action is one a brahman.6
              
              
                Know, too, by this,
                as I give an example:
                Sopāka, the son of an outcaste,
                was well-known as Mātaṅga:
                He, Mātaṅga,
                attained the highest prestige,
                hard to gain.
                They came into his service,
                many noble warriors & brahmans.
                Mounting the divine chariot,7
                and the great, stainless road,
                dispassioned for sensual passion,
                he reached the world of the Brahmās.
                His birth didn’t prevent him
                from reaching the world of the Brahmās.
              
              
                Though born into a family of scholars,
                brahmans, with chants as their kinsmen,
                are repeatedly seen with evil deeds:
                blameworthy in the here-&-now,
                with a bad destination in the afterlife.
                Their birth doesn’t prevent them
                from blame & a bad destination.
              
              
                Not by birth is one an outcaste,
                not by birth a brahman.
                By action one is an outcaste.
                By action is one a brahman.
              
            
            When this was said, the brahman Aggika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”

              This is to be done by one skilled in aims
              appreciating the state of peace:
              Be capable, upright, & straightforward,
              easy to instruct, gentle, & not conceited,
              content & easy to support,
              with few duties, living lightly,
              with peaceful faculties, astute,
              modest, & no greed for supporters.
              
                Do not do the slightest thing
                that the observant would later censure.
              
              
                Think: Happy, at rest,
                may all beings be happy at heart.
                Whatever beings there may be,
                weak or strong, without exception,
                long, large,
                middling, short,
                subtle, gross,
                seen & unseen,
                living near & far away,
                born or seeking birth:
                May all beings be happy at heart.
                Let no one deceive another
                or despise anyone anywhere,
                or, through anger or resistance-perception,
                wish for another to suffer.
              
              
                As a mother would risk her life
                to protect her child, her only child,
                even so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly
                with regard to all beings.1
                With goodwill for the entire cosmos,
                cultivate the heart limitlessly:
                above, below, & all around,
                unobstructed, without hostility or hate.
                Whether standing, walking,
                sitting, or lying down,
                as long as one has banished torpor,
                one should be resolved on this mindfulness.2
                This is called a Brahmā abiding
                here.
              
              
                Not taken with views,
                but virtuous & consummate in vision,
                having subdued greed for sensuality,
                one never again
                will lie in the womb.

              1. The image here is sometimes misconstrued as saying that one should protect all beings as a mother would protect her only child. Actually, the parallel is not between the child and all living beings; it is between the child and one’s cultivation of the heart: One should protect one’s goodwill toward all beings in the same way that a mother would protect her only child. On this point, see MN 21.
              2. This line has to be read in line with the Buddha’s definition of mindfulness as the ability to keep something in mind.

                enlightened,
                with legs like an antelope, thin,
                eating little, not greedy,

                indifferent to sensuality,
                let’s ask him
                about release from Death’s snare.
                Let’s ask Gotama,
                proclaimer, preacher,
                attained to the far shore
                of all phenomena:

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Āḷavī in the haunt of the Āḷavaka yakkha. Then the Āḷavaka yakkha went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him: “Get out, contemplative!”
            [Saying,] “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went out.
            “Come in, contemplative!”
            “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went in.
            A second time.… A third time, the Āḷavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, “Get out, contemplative!”

            “Come in, contemplative!”
            “All right, my friend,” the Blessed One went in.
            Then a fourth time, the Āḷavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, “Get out, contemplative!”
            “I won’t go out, my friend. Do what you have to do.”
            “I will ask you a question, contemplative. If you can’t answer me, I will hurl out your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges.”
            “My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, who could hurl out my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges.

              Whether walking, standing,
              sitting, or lying down,
              it flexes & stretches:
              This is the body’s movement.
              Joined together with tendons & bones,
              plastered over with muscle & skin,
              hidden by complexion,
              the body isn’t seen
              for what it is:
              filled with intestines, filled with stomach,

              mucus, sweat, saliva, fat,
              blood, synovial fluid, bile, & oil.
              On top of that,
              in nine streams,
              filth is always flowing from it—
              from the eyes : eye secretions,
              from the ears : ear secretions,
              from the nose : mucus,
              from the mouth it vomits :
              now vomit,
              now phlegm,
              now bile;
              from the body : beads of sweat.
              
                And on top of that,
                its hollow head is filled with brains.
                The fool, beset by ignorance,
                thinks it beautiful,
                but when it lies dead,
                swollen, livid,
                cast away in a charnel ground,
                even relatives don’t care for it.
                Dogs feed on it,
                jackals, wolves, & worms.
                Crows & vultures feed on it,
                along with any other animals there.
              
              
                Having heard the Awakened One’s words,
                the discerning monk
                comprehends, for he sees it
                for what it is:
                “As this is, so is that.
                As that, so this.”
                Within & without,
                he should let desire for the body
                fade away.
                With desire & passion faded away,
                the discerning monk arrives here:
                at the deathless,

                the unfallen, undying1 state

                oozing out here & there:
                Whoever would think,
                on the basis of a body like this,
                to exalt himself or disparage another—

                or nourish what’s taking birth:
                They call him the wandering, solitary sage.
                He, the great seer
                has seen
                the state of peace.
              
              
                Considering the ground,
                crushing the seed,
                he wouldn’t nourish the sap4
                —truly a sage—
                seer of the ending of birth,
                abandoning conjecture,
                he cannot be classified.
              
              
                Knowing all dwellings,5
                not longing for any one anywhere
                —truly a sage—
                with no coveting, without greed,
                he does not build,6
                for he has gone          beyond.
              
              
                Conquering     all
                knowing     all,

                Abandoning     all,

                like the pillar at a bathing ford,9
                when others speak in extremes;
                he, without passion,
                his senses well-centered:
                The enlightened call him a sage.
              
              
                Truly poised, straight as a shuttle,10
                he loathes evil actions.

                The enlightened call him a sage.
              
              
                Restrained in mind, he does no evil.
                Young & middle-aged,
                the sage self-controlled,
                never angered, he angers none:
                The enlightened call him a sage.
              
              
                From the best
                the middling
                the leftovers
                he receives alms.
                Sustaining himself on what others give,
                neither flattering
                nor speaking disparagement:
                The enlightened call him a sage.
              
              
                The wandering sage
                abstaining from sex,
                in youth bound by no one,
                abstaining from intoxication12
                complacency,
                totally apart:
                The enlightened call him a sage.
              
              
                Knowing the world,
                seeing the highest goal,
                crossing the ocean,13 the flood,14
                —Such15—
                his chains broken,
                unattached,
                without effluent:
                The enlightened call him a sage.
              
              
                These two are different,
                they dwell far apart:
                the householder supporting a wife
                and the unselfish one, of good practices.
                Slaying other beings, the householder
                is unrestrained.
                Constantly the sage protects other beings,
                is controlled.
              
              
                Just as the crested,
                blue-necked peacock,
                when flying,
                never matches
                the wild goose
                in speed,
                even so the householder
                never keeps up with the monk—
                the sage secluded
                in the forest,
                doing jhāna.
              
            
            vv. 207–221",No Introduction,"s
              1. SnA: Dangers in intimacy = Craving and views.
              2. SnA: Dust = Passion, aversion, and delusion.
              3. This verse is quoted in the Milinda Pañhā. The poem as a whole is apparently the same as the Munigāthā mentioned in King Asoka’s Calcutta-Bairāṭ edict.
              4. SnA: Ground, seed, and sap = The aggregates, sense media, and properties form the ground in which grows the seed of constructive consciousness—the consciousness that develops into states of being and birth. (For other instances of this image, see SN 22:53­–55.) The sap of this seed is craving and views.
              5. SnA: Dwellings (nivesanāni) = States of becoming and birth. This term can also be translated as “entrenchments.” See Sn 4:3, note 2.
              6. SnA: He does not build = He performs none of the good or bad deeds that give rise to further states of becoming and birth. See Dhp 39, 267, and 412.
              7. Effluent (āsava): Three qualities—sensual desire, states of becoming, or ignorance—that “flow out” of the mind and defile it. Sometimes a fourth quality—views—is added to the list, to connect these qualities with the four floods (ogha), which are identical to the four yokes. See AN 4:10.
              8. See Sn 1:3.
              9. The pillar at a bathing ford: Cv V.l describes this as an immovable pillar, standing quite tall and buried deep in the ground near a bathing place, against which young villagers and boxers would rub their bodies while bathing so as to toughen them. The “extremes” in which others speak, according to SnA, are extremes of praise and criticism: These leave the sage, like the pillar, unmoved.
              10. SnA: Straight as a shuttle = Having a mind unprejudiced by desire, aversion, delusion, or fear. See AN 4:19.
              11. Consonant and discordant (sama and visama): Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments were metaphors for good. In Pali, the term sama—”even”—described an instrument tuned on-pitch. AN 6:55 contains a famous passage in which the Buddha reminds Ven. Soṇa Kolivisa—who had been over-exerting himself in the practice—that a lute sounds appealing only if the strings are neither too taut nor too lax, but “evenly” tuned. This image would have special resonances with the Buddha’s teaching on the middle way. It also adds meaning to the term samaṇa—monk or contemplative—which the texts frequently mention as being derived from sama. The word sāmañña—”evenness,” the quality of being concordant and in tune—also means the quality of being a contemplative. The true contemplative is always in tune with what is proper and good.","DN 2, MN 61, MN 97. Nd II, in commenting on Sn 4:2, equates discordant conduct with the ten types of misconduct described in MN 41.
              12. Intoxication: The three intoxications are intoxication with youth, with good health, and with life. See AN 3:39.
              13. SnA: Ocean = The way defilement splashes into undesirable destinations.
              14. Flood: The flow of defilement: sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance. See SN 45:171.
              15. Such (tādiṁ): Unchanging; unaffected by anything, while at the same time undefined.

                The exquisite deathless—ending, dispassion—
                discovered by the Sakyan Sage in concentration:
                There is nothing to equal that Dhamma.

                They, disciples of the One Well-Gone, deserve offerings.

                At the moment of attaining sight,

                identity-views, uncertainty,
                & any attachment to habits & practices.4
                One is completely released

                one cannot hide it:
                an incapability ascribed
                to one who has seen the Way.
                This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saṅgha.

                they,
                with no seed,
                no desire for growth,
                enlightened,     go out like this flame.7

              1. This is apparently equivalent to the liberation of immediacy, mentioned in Thig 5:8, and the concentration that is the fruit of gnosis, mentioned in AN 9:37.
              2. Indra-pillar: A tall hardwood pillar, planted at the entrance to a village. Similar analogies for the awakened mind are found at AN 6:55 and AN 9:26.
              3. The person who has reached this stage in the practice will be reborn at most seven more times. See AN 3:88. On the danger of heedlessness for one who has reached this level of awakening, see SN 55:40.
              4. These three qualities are the fetters abandoned when one gains one’s first glimpse of unbinding at stream-entry (the moment when one enters the stream to full awakening).
              5. Four states of deprivation: rebirth as an animal, a hungry ghost, an angry demon, or a denizen of hell. In the Buddhist cosmology, none of these states is eternal.
              6. According to SnA, the six great wrongs are: murdering one’s mother, murdering one’s father, murdering an arahant (fully awakened individual), wounding a Buddha, causing a schism in the Saṅgha, or choosing anyone other than a Buddha as one’s foremost teacher. The first five are listed in AN 5:129 as leading immediately to hell after death.

                while consuming cooked rice
                and the well-prepared fleshes of birds.
                So I ask you, Kassapa, the meaning of that:
                Of what sort is ‘raw stench’ for you?”
              
              
                The Buddha Kassapa:
                “Killing living beings,
                hunting, cutting, binding,
                theft, lying, fraud, deceptions,
                useless recitations,
                associating with the wives of others:
                This is a raw stench,
                not the eating of meat.
              
              
                Those people here
                who are unrestrained in sensuality,
                greedy for flavors,
                mixed together with what’s impure,
                annihilationists,
                discordant1 & indomitable:
                This is a raw stench,
                not the eating of meat.
              
              
                Those who are rough, pitiless,
                eating the flesh off your back,
                betraying their friends,
                uncompassionate, arrogant,
                habitually ungenerous,
                giving to no one:
                This is a raw stench,
                not the eating of meat.
              
              
                Anger, intoxication,
                stubbornness, hostility,
                deceptiveness, resentment,
                boasting, conceit & pride,
                befriending those of no integrity:
                This is a raw stench,
                not the eating of meat.
              
              
                Those of evil habits,
                debt-repudiators, informers,
                cheats in trading, counterfeiters,
                vile men who do evil things:
                This is a raw stench,

                Those people here
                who are unrestrained toward beings,
                taking what’s others’,
                intent on injury,
                immoral hunters, harsh, disrespectful:
                This is a raw stench,
                not the eating of meat.
              
              
                Those who are very greedy,
                constantly intent
                on hindering and killing;
                beings who, after passing away,
                go to darkness,
                fall headfirst into hell:
                This is a raw stench,
                not the eating of meat.
              
              
                No fish & meat,2
                no fasting, no nakedness,
                no shaven head, no tangled hair,

                no performance of fire oblations,
                or the many austerities
                to become an immortal in the world,
                no chants, no oblations,
                no performance of sacrifices
                at the proper season—
                purify a mortal
                who hasn’t crossed over doubt.
              
              
                One should go about
                guarded
                with regard to those things,
                one’s faculties understood,

                delighting in being straightforward
                & mild.
                Attachments past,
                all suffering abandoned,
                the enlightened one
                isn’t smeared
                by what’s heard or seen.”
              
              
                Thus the Blessed One,
                explained the meaning again & again.
                The one
                who had mastered chants
                understood it.
                With variegated verses
                the sage—
                free from raw stench,
                unfettered, indomitable3—

                the one with lowered mind
                paid homage to the Tathāgata,
                chose the Going Forth right there.

            I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she addressed him with a verse.
            
              “Many devas & human beings
              give thought to protection,
              desiring well-being.
              Tell, then, the highest protection.”

            “That’s not a contemplative. That’s a fake contemplative. I’ll find out whether that’s a contemplative or a fake contemplative.”
            So Suciloma the yakkha approached the Blessed One and on arrival leaned his body up against the Blessed One. The Blessed One leaned his body away. So Suciloma the yakkha said to the Blessed One, “Are you afraid of me, contemplative?”
            “No, I’m not afraid of you, friend, just that your touch is evil.”
            “I will ask you a question, contemplative. If you can’t answer me, I will hurl out your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges.”
            “My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, in this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk, who could hurl out my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges. But nevertheless, ask me what you wish.”

                who think they’re contemplatives.
                Having swept away those of evil desires, evil
                in behavior & range,
                then pure, affiliate mindfully
                with the pure.
                Then, united, astute,
                you will put an end
                to suffering & stress.2

Sn 2:7  Brahman Principles,Sn 2:7,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp2_7.html,"Sn 2:7  Brahman Principles  —  How brahmans, through greed, abandoned the good principles of their ancestors.","KN/Sn/2:7
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then many Kosalan brahmans of great means—old, aged, advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life—approached the Blessed One. On arrival, they exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to him, “Master Gotama, do brahmans at present live in conformity with the brahman principles of ancient brahmans?”
            “No, brahmans. Brahmans at present don’t live in conformity with the brahman principles of ancient brahmans.”
            “It would be good if Master Gotama described the brahman principles of ancient brahmans, if it wouldn’t burden him.”
            “In that case, brahmans, listen and pay close attention. I will speak.”
            “As you say, master,” the brahmans of great means responded to the Blessed One.
            The Blessed One said:
            
              Seers, before,     were austere
              & restrained in mind.
              Abandoning the five strings of sensuality,
              they practiced for their own benefit.
              They had          no cattle,
              no gold,
              no wealth.
              They had study
              as their wealth.
              They protected the Brahmā treasure.1
              They did not despise what was prepared for them:
              food set at doors, prepared out of conviction
              for those who seek.
              
                Prosperous lands & kingdoms
                honored brahmans with multi-colored clothes,
                bedding, & dwellings.
                Brahmans
                protecting their principles,
                protected by law,2
                were not to be violated,
                not to be beaten.
                No one could block them
                from the doors of any home.
              
              
                For 48 years (young brahmans)
                followed the holy life.
                Brahmans of old practiced the search
                for knowledge & conduct.
                Brahmans went to no other (caste),3
                nor did they buy their wives.
                Living together from mutual love,
                having come together, they found joy together.
                Aside from the time
                after menstruation,
                brahmans didn’t engage
                in copulation.
              
              
                They praised:
                the holy life, virtue,
                being straightforward, mild, austere,
                composed, harmless, enduring.
                The foremost brahman among them,
                firm in perseverance,
                didn’t engage in copulation
                even in a dream.
                Those imitating his practice
                praised the holy life, virtue,
                & endurance.
                They asked for rice, bedding, cloth,
                butter & oil.
                Having collected all that
                in line with rectitude,
                from that
                they performed the sacrifice.
                And in setting up the sacrifice,
                they didn’t harm cows.
              
              
                “Like a mother, father,
                brother, or other relative,
                cows are our foremost friends.
                From them comes medicine.
                They give food, strength,
                beauty, & happiness.”
              
              
                Knowing this line of reasoning,
                they didn’t harm cows.
                Delicate, with large bodies,
                beautiful, prestigious,
                brahmans were committed to standards
                of what should & shouldn’t be done
                in line with their principles.
                As long as this lasted in the world,
                humanity prospered in happiness.
              
              
                But a perversion came among them.
                Seeing, little by little,
                the splendor of kings—
                women well-ornamented,
                chariots yoked to thoroughbreds,
                well-made, with elaborate embroideries,
                houses & homes,
                well-proportioned, planned & laid out
                lavish human wealth,
                surrounded by circles of cows,
                joined with groups of excellent women—
                the brahmans grew greedy.
                Having composed chants there,
                they went up to Okkāka.
              
              
                “You have much wealth & grain.
                Sacrifice! Much is your property!
                Sacrifice! Much is your wealth!”
              
              
                Then the king, lord of charioteers,
                induced by the brahmans,
                having performed these sacrifices—
                the horse sacrifice, the human sacrifice,
                sammāpāsa, vājapeyya, & niraggaḷa4—
                gave the brahmans wealth:
                cows, bedding, clothes,
                women adorned,
                chariots yoked to thoroughbreds,
                well-made, with elaborate embroideries,
                Having had delightful homes,
                well-proportioned, filled throughout5
                with various grains,
                he gave the brahmans wealth.
              
              
                And they, receiving the wealth there,
                found joy together in hoarding it.
                Overcome by desire,
                their craving grew more.
                Having composed chants there,
                they went up to Okkāka again.
              
              
                “Like water & earth,
                gold, wealth, & grain,
                are cows to human beings.
                This is a requisite for beings.
                Sacrifice! Much is your property!
                Sacrifice! Much is your wealth!”
              
              
                Then the king, lord of charioteers,
                induced by the brahmans,
                killed in a sacrifice
                many hundred-thousands of cows.
                The cows—
                meek like sheep,
                giving milk by the bucket—
                hadn’t,
                with their hooves or horns or
                anything else, done
                anyone
                any harm.
                But the king,
                grabbing them by the horns,
                killed them with a knife.
              
              
                Then the devas, the Fathers,
                Indra, and rakkhasas
                cried out,
                “An injustice!”
                when the knife fell on the cows.
              
              
                Three were the diseases before then:
                desire, hunger, & aging.
                But from violence against cattle
                came ninety-eight.
                This injustice of violence
                has come down as ancient.
                The innocent are killed;
                the sacrificers fall away
                from the Dhamma.
              
              
                This tradition—ancient, vile—
                is criticized by the observant.
                Where people see such a thing,
                they criticize the sacrificer.
                With the Dhamma perishing in this way,
                merchants are split          from workers,
                noble warriors are split     far apart,
                the wife despises the husband.
                Noble warriors, kinsman of Brahmā,
                and any others protected by clan,
                repudiating the doctrine of their birth, fall
                under sensuality’s
                sway.
              
            
            When this was said, those brahmans of great means said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. We go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”

              —as the devas, Indra—
              one from whom

                How can he help others across?

                He who hasn’t

                would—thoughtful, skillful,

                of learning & understanding.
              
              
                When a person is hasty & heedless
                his discernment & learning
                don’t grow.
                While those who delight
                in the Dhamma taught by the noble ones,
                are unsurpassed
                in word, action, & mind.
                They, established in
                calm,
                composure, &
                concentration,
                have reached
                what discernment & learning
                have as their heartwood.”4
              
            
            vv. 324–330","            This sutta mentions the metaphorical notion of “heartwood” (sāra) three times. Although sāra as a metaphor is often translated as “essence,” this misses some of the metaphor’s implications. When x is said to have y as its heartwood, that means that the proper development of x yields y, and that y is the most valuable part of x—just as a tree, as it matures, develops heartwood, and the heartwood is the most valuable part of the tree.

              1. According to SnA, one’s superiors include those who have more wisdom than oneself, more skill in concentration and other aspects of the path than oneself, and those senior to oneself.
              2. SnA says that the right time to see a teacher is when one is overcome with passion, aversion, and delusion, and cannot find a way out on one’s own. This echoes a passage in AN 6:26, in which Ven. Mahā Kaccāna says that the right time to visit a “monk worthy of esteem” is when one needs help in overcoming any of the five hindrances or when one doesn’t yet have an appropriate theme to focus on to put an end to the mind’s effluents.
              3. SnA equates “words destructive of the Dhamma” with “animal talk.” See the discussion under Pācittiya 85 in The Buddhist Monastic Code. 
              4. The heartwood of learning & discernment is release. See MN 29 and 30.",: MN 29–30; AN 5:151; AN 5:202; AN 6:86; AN 8:53; AN 10:58; Thag 5:10

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava shrine. And on that occasion Ven. Vaṅgīsa’s1 preceptor, an elder named Nigrodha Kappa, had recently totally unbound at the Aggāḷava shrine. Then as Ven. Vaṅgīsa was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in his awareness: “Has my preceptor totally unbound, or has he not totally unbound?”
            Then, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, Ven. Vaṅgīsa went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Just now, as I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in my awareness: ‘Has my preceptor totally unbound, or has he not totally unbound?’”
            Then, arranging his robe over one shoulder and placing his hands palm-to-palm over his heart toward the Blessed One, Ven. Vaṅgīsa addressed the Blessed One in verses:
            
              “We ask the Teacher of supreme discernment,
              who has cut off uncertainty in the here-&-now:
              A monk has died at the Aggāḷava shrine—
              well-known, prestigious, with mind fully unbound.
              
                Nigrodha Kappa was his name,
                given by you, Blessed One, to that brahman.
                He went about revering you—
                who sees the firm Dhamma—
                intent on release, with persistence aroused.
              
              
                Sakyan, All-around Eye,2
                we all, too, want to know of that disciple:
                Ready to hear are our ears.
                You, our teacher: You are unexcelled.
              
              
                Cut through our uncertainty. Tell me this,
                make known, One of discernment deep,
                that he was totally unbound.
                Like Thousand-eyed Sakka, in the midst of the devas,3

                On reaching the Tathāgata, they don’t exist,

                For if no man were ever to disperse defilements—
                as the wind, a dark mass of clouds—
                the whole world would be enveloped in darkness.
                Even brilliant people wouldn’t shine bright.
              
              
                But the enlightened are makers of light.
                Thus I think you’re that, enlightened one.

                Pleading, I shall get the pure one to speak,
                he whose birth & death are abandoned.
                For people run-of-the-mill haven’t the power
                to bring about what they desire,
                but Tathāgatas do have the power
                to bring about what they have pondered.
              
              
                This, your consummate explanation,
                is rightly-grasped, you of discernment
                rightly straight.
                This last salutation is offered:
                Knowing, don’t delude us,

                I long for the water of your speech

                Was the holy life, as led by Kappa
                in line with his aim? Was it not in any way in vain?
                Did he unbind with no fuel remaining?6

                the current of the Dark One, the long-time obsession.

                Surely, my question was not in vain,
                nor was I deceived by the brahman.
                As he spoke, so he acted:
                He was a disciple

From Vedic times it was customary to believe that divine beings had total vision of reality because they could see with all parts of their bodies—thus they were “all-around eyes.” At the same time, there was a belief that it was auspicious to gaze into a divine being’s eye, which meant that worshippers were content to see any part of the divine being’s body. Both of these beliefs carried over into Buddhist devotional practice. For more on this point, see DN 16, note 44.",", Jan Gonda, Eye and Gaze in the Veda.

                Putting behind him
                divisive tale-bearing,

                or be elated on receiving food from another:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Fully abandoning greed & becoming,
                abstaining from cutting & binding (other beings),

                Having found what’s appropriate for himself,
                the monk wouldn’t harm anyone in the world,
                Having found the Dhamma as it actually is,
                he would wander rightly in the world.

                not following factions among those who are factious,
                enlightened; his greed, aversion, & irritation subdued:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Victorious, pure, his roof opened up,3
                a master of dhammas, gone beyond
                & unperturbed,
                skilled in the knowledge of fabrication-cessation:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Gone beyond speculations
                about futures & pasts,
                and—having passed by—
                purified in his discernment,
                fully released from all sense-media4:
                He would wander rightly in the world.
              
              
                Knowing          the state,
                meeting          the Dhamma,
                seeing          the opened-up
                when his effluents
                are abandoned
                from the ending
                of all acquisitions:
                He would wander rightly in the world.”
              
              
                “Yes, Blessed One, that’s just how it is.
                Any monk dwelling thus,
                tamed, gone totally beyond
                all things
                conducive for fetters5:
                He would wander rightly in the world.”

Sn 2:14  Dhammika,Sn 2:14,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp2_14.html,Sn 2:14  Dhammika  —  The proper code of conduct for lay followers of the Dhamma.,"KN/Sn/2:14
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Dhammika the lay follower, together with 500 other lay followers, approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he addressed the Blessed One in verses:
            
              “I ask you, Gotama, Deeply Discerning:
              How-acting does one become a good disciple—
              either one gone from home into homelessness,
              or a lay follower with a home?
              
                For you discern the destination & future course
                of the world along with its devas
                —there is no one equal to you
                in seeing the subtle goal;
                for they call you foremost, awakened.
              
              
                Understanding all knowledge
                the whole Dhamma,1
                you proclaim it to beings with sympathetic mind.
                Your roof opened up,2 All-around Eye,3
                you, stainless, illumine the whole world.
              
              
                He came to your presence—
                Erāvaṇa, the nāga king,4
                having heard, ‘Conqueror.’
                Having consulted with you, having heard,
                he understood and, satisfied,
                (thought,) ‘Good.’
              
              
                And King Vessavaṇa Kuvera5
                came, inquiring about the Dhamma.
                To him, too, you spoke when asked.
                And he too, having heard, was satisfied.
              
              
                And these sectarians, debaters by habit,
                whether Ājīvakas or Nigaṇṭhas,
                don’t overtake you in terms of discernment,
                as a person standing
                doesn’t catch up
                with one going quickly.
              
              
                And these brahmans, debaters by habit,
                any elderly brahmans,
                and any others who consider themselves debaters,
                all depend on you for the meaning.
              
              
                For this Dhamma is subtle & blissful.
                This, Blessed One, well set-forth by you:
                We all want to hear it.
                Tell it to us, Excellent Awakened, when asked.
              
              
                All these monks are sitting together—
                and the lay followers, right there—to hear.
                Let them listen to the Dhamma
                awakened to by one who is stainless,
                as the devas listen to Vasavant’s6 well-spoken word.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Listen to me, monks. I will let you hear
                the Dhamma of polishing away. Live by it,7 all of you.
                May those who are thoughtful, seeing the purpose,
                partake of the duties proper for one gone forth.
              
              
                A monk should surely not wander
                at the wrong time.
                He should go for alms in the village
                at the right time.
                For attachments get attached to one going
                at the wrong time.
                That’s why they don’t wander at the wrong time,
                the awakened.
              
              
                Sights, sounds, tastes,
                smells, & tactile sensations
                intoxicate beings.
                Subduing desire for these things,
                one should, at the right time, enter for alms.
              
              
                Having received alms in proper season,
                a monk, returning alone, should sit down in solitude.
                Pondering what’s inside, his mind-state collected,
                he should not let his heart wander outside.
              
              
                If he should converse with a disciple,
                a monk, or anyone else,
                he should utter the exquisite Dhamma,
                and not divisive speech or disparagement of others.
              
              
                For some retaliate against arguments.
                We don’t praise those of limited discernment.
                Attachments get attached on account of this & that,
                for they send their minds far away from there.
              
              
                Having heard the Dhamma taught by the One Well-Gone,
                the disciple of foremost discernment, having considered it,
                should resort to almsfood, a dwelling, a place to sit & lie down,
                and water for washing dust from his robe.
              
              
                So a monk should stay unsmeared by these things—
                almsfood, a dwelling, a place to sit & lie down,
                and water for washing dust from his robe—
                like a water-drop on a lotus.
              
              
                As for the householder protocol,
                I will tell you how-acting
                one becomes a good disciple,
                since the entire monk-practice
                can’t be managed by those wealthy in property.
              
              
                Laying aside violence toward all living creatures,
                both the firm & unfirm in the world,
                one should not kill a living being, nor have it killed,
                nor condone killing by others.
              
              
                Then the disciple should avoid
                consciously (taking) what’s not given,
                —anything, anywhere—
                should not have it taken
                nor condone its taking.
                He should avoid all (taking of) what’s not given.
              
              
                The observant person should avoid uncelibate behavior
                like a pit of glowing embers.
                But if he’s incapable of celibate behavior,
                he should not transgress with the wife of another.
              
              
                When gone to an audience hall or assembly,
                or one-on-one, he should not tell a lie,
                nor have it told, nor condone it’s being told.
                He should avoid every untruth.
              
              
                Any householder who approves of this Dhamma
                should not take intoxicating drink,
                nor have others drink it, nor condone its being drunk,
                knowing that it ends in madness.
              
              
                For from intoxication, fools do evil things
                and get others, heedless, to do them.
                One should avoid this opening to demerit—
                madness, delusion—appealing to fools.
              
              
                One should not kill a living being,
                take what’s not given, tell a lie, nor be a drinker.
                One should abstain from uncelibate behavior—
                sexual intercourse—should not eat at night,
                a meal at the wrong time,
                should not wear a garland or use scents,
                should sleep on a bed, on the ground, or on a mat,
                For this, they say, is the eightfold uposatha,
                proclaimed by the Awakened One
                who has gone to the end of suffering & stress.
              
              
                Then, having kept, well-accomplished,
                the eightfold uposatha
                on the fourteenth, fifteenth, & eighth
                of the fortnight,8
                and on special days of the fortnight,
                with clear & confident mind,
                the observant person
                at dawn after the uposatha,
                confident, rejoicing,
                should share food & drink, as is proper,
                with the Saṅgha of monks.
              
              
                One should righteously support mother & father,
                should engage in righteous9 trade,
                One heedful in this householder protocol
                goes to the devas called
                Self-radiant.”

              I will praise the Going Forth,
              how he went forth, the One with Eyes,
              how he reasoned and chose the Going Forth.
              “Household life is confining,
              a realm of dust,
              while going forth
              is the open air.”
              Seeing this, he went forth.
              
                On going forth,
                he avoided evil deeds in body.
                Abandoning verbal misconduct,
                he purified his livelihood.
                Then he, the Buddha, went to Rājagaha,
                the mountain fortress of the Magadhans,
                and wandered for alms,
                teeming with the foremost marks.
                King Bimbisāra, standing in his palace, saw him,
                and on seeing him, consummate in marks,
                said this:
                “Look at this one, sirs.
                How handsome, stately, pure!
                How consummate his demeanor!
                Mindful, his eyes downcast,
                looking only a plow-length before him.
                This one’s not like one
                from a lowly lineage:
                Have the royal messengers hurry
                to see where this monk will go.”
              
              
                They—the messengers dispatched—
                followed behind him.
                “Where will this monk go?
                Where will his dwelling place be?”
                As he went from house to house—
                well-restrained, his sense-doors guarded,
                mindful, alert—
                his bowl filled quickly.
                Then he, the sage, completing his alms round,
                left the city, headed for Mount Paṇḍava.
                “That’s where his dwelling will be.”
                Seeing him go to his dwelling place,
                three messengers sat down,
                while one returned to tell the king.
                “That monk, your majesty,
                on the flank of Paṇḍava,
                sits like a tiger, a bull,
                a lion in a mountain cleft.”
              
              
                Hearing the messenger’s words,
                the noble-warrior king
                straight away set out by royal coach,
                for Mount Paṇḍava.
                Going as far as the coach would go,
                the noble-warrior king
                got down from the coach,
                went up on foot,
                and on arrival sat down.
                Sitting there,
                he exchanged courteous greetings,
                and after giving friendly greetings,
                said this:
                “Young you are, and youthful,
                in the first stage of youth,
                consummate in stature & coloring
                like a noble-warrior by birth.
                You would look glorious
                in the vanguard of an army,
                arrayed with an elephant squadron.
                I offer you wealth : Enjoy it.

                “Straight ahead, your majesty,
                by the foothills of the Himalayas,
                is a country consummate
                in energy & wealth,

                Solar by clan,
                Sakyans by birth.
                From that lineage I have gone forth,
                but not in hope of sensuality.
                Seeing the danger in sensuality
                —and renunciation as rest—
                I go to strive.
              
              
                That’s where my heart delights.”

              To me—
              my mind resolute in exertion
              near the river Nerañjarā,
              making a great effort,
              doing jhāna
              to attain rest from the yoke—
              
                Nāmuci1 came,
                speaking words of compassion:
                “You are ashen, thin.
                Death is in
                your presence.
                Death
                has 1,000 parts of you.
                Only one part
                is your life.
                Live, good sir!
                Life is better.
                Alive,
                you can do
                acts of merit.
                Your living the holy life
                and performing the fire sacrifice
                will heap up much merit.
                What use is exertion to you?
                Hard to follow
                —the path of exertion—
                hard to do, hard
                to sustain.”
              
              
                Saying these verses,
                Māra stood in the Awakened One’s presence.
                And to that Māra, speaking thus,
                the Blessed One
                said this:
              
              
                “Kinsman of the heedless,
                Evil One,
                come here for whatever purpose:
                I haven’t, for merit,
                even the least bit of need.
                Those who have need of merit:
                Those are the ones
                Māra’s fit to address.
              
              
                In me are
                conviction
                austerity,
                persistence,
                discernment.
                Why, when my mind is resolute,
                do you petition me
                to live?
                This wind could burn up
                even river currents.
                Why, when my mind is resolute,
                shouldn’t my blood dry away?
                As my blood dries up,
                gall & phlegm dry up,
                as muscles waste away,
                the mind grows clearer;
                mindfulness, discernment,
                concentration stand
                more firm.
                Staying in this way,
                attaining the ultimate feeling,2
                the mind has no interest
                in sensuality.
                See:
                a being’s
                purity!
              
              
                Sensual passions are your first army.
                Your second     is called Discontent.
                Your third     is Hunger & Thirst.
                Your fourth     is called Craving.
                Fifth     is Sloth & Torpor.
                Sixth     is called Cowardice.
                Your seventh     is Uncertainty.
                Hypocrisy & Stubbornness, your eighth.
                Gains, Offerings, Fame, & Status
                wrongly gained,
                and whoever would praise self
                & disparage others:
              
              
                That, Nāmuci, is your army,
                the Dark One’s commando force.
                A coward can’t defeat it,
                but one having defeated it
                gains bliss.
                Do I carry muñja grass?3
                I spit on my life.
                Death in battle would be better for me
                than that I, defeated,
                survive.4
              
              
                Sinking here, they don’t appear,
                some brahmans & contemplatives.
                They don’t know the path
                by which those with good practices
                go.
              
              
                Seeing the bannered force
                on all sides—
                the troops, Māra
                along with his mount—
                I go into battle.
                May they not budge me
                from
                my spot.
                That army of yours,
                that the world with its devas
                can’t overcome,
                I will smash          with discernment—
                as an unfired pot     with a stone.
              
              
                Making my     resolve mastered,
                mindfulness well-established,
                I will go about, from kingdom to kingdom,
                training many disciples.
                They—heedful, resolute in mind,
                doing my bidding—
                despite your wishes, will go
                where, having gone,
                there’s no grief.”
              
              
                Māra:
                “For seven years, I’ve dogged
                the Blessed One’s steps,
                but haven’t gained an opening
                in the One Self-Awakened
                & glorious.
                A crow circled a stone
                the color of fat
                —’Maybe I’ve found
                something tender here.
                Maybe there’s something delicious’—
                but not getting anything delicious there,
                the crow went away.
                Like the crow attacking the rock,
                I weary myself with Gotama.”
              
              
                As he was overcome with sorrow,
                his lute fell from under his arm.
                Then he, the despondent spirit,
                right there
                disappeared.

              3. Muñja grass was the ancient Indian equivalent of a white flag. A warrior expecting that he might have to surrender would take muñja grass into battle with him. If he did surrender, he would lie down with the muñja grass in his mouth. The Buddha, in asking this rhetorical question, is indicating that he is not the type of warrior who would carry muñja grass. If defeated, he would rather die than surrender.

Sn 3:3  Well-spoken,Sn 3:3,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_3.html,Sn 3:3  Well-spoken  —  Four characteristics of well-spoken speech.,"KN/Sn/3:3
           I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There he addressed the monks, “Monks!”
            “Yes, lord,” the monks responded to him.
            The Blessed One said: “Monks, speech endowed with four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken—faultless & not to be faulted by the observant. Which four? There is the case where a monk says only what is well-spoken, not what is poorly spoken; only what is just, not what is unjust; only what is endearing, not what is unendearing; only what is true, not what is false. Speech endowed with these four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken—faultless & not to be faulted by the observant.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              The calm say that what is well-spoken is best;
              second, that one should say
              what is just, not unjust;
              third,          what’s endearing, not unendearing;
              fourth,          what is true, not false.
            
            Then Ven. Vaṅgīsa,1 rising from his seat, arranging his robe over one shoulder, faced the Blessed One with his hands palm-to-palm in front of his heart and said, “An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, One Well-Gone!”
            “Let the inspiration come to you, Vaṅgīsa,” the Blessed One said.
            Then Ven. Vaṅgīsa praised the Blessed One to his face with these fitting verses:
            
              “Speak only the speech
              that neither torments self
              nor does harm to others.
              That speech is truly well-spoken.
              
                Speak only endearing speech,
                speech that is welcomed.
                Speech when it brings no evil
                to others
                is pleasant.
              
              
                Truth, indeed, is deathless speech:
                This is a primeval principle.
                The goal and the Dhamma
                —so say the calm—
                are firmly established on truth.
              
              
                The speech the Awakened One speaks,
                for attaining unbinding,
                rest,
                for making an end
                to the mass of stress:
                That is the speech unsurpassed.”

            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kosalans on the bank of the River Sundarika. And on that occasion, the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja was offering a fire sacrifice and performing a fire oblation on the bank of the River Sundarika. Then, having offered the fire sacrifice and performed the fire oblation, he got up from his seat and looked around to the four directions, (thinking,) “Who should eat the remains of the offering?” He saw the Blessed One sitting not far away at the root of a tree with his head covered. On seeing him, he took the remains of the offering in his left hand and his water-pot in his right, and went to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, at the sound of the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja’s footsteps, uncovered his head. The brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja (thinking,) “This venerable one is shaven. This venerable one is a shaveling,” wanted to turn back. But then the thought occurred to him, “Still, there are some brahmans who are shaven. What if, having approached him, I were to ask his caste?”
            So he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, asked: “What is the venerable one’s birth-caste?”1
            Then the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja in verse:
            
              “I’m not a brahman or king’s son,
              not a merchant, or anyone at all.2
              Comprehending the clan
              of the run-of-the-mill,3
              having nothing,
              I wander by means of wisdom
              in the world.
              Wearing my outer robe,
              I wander without home,
              my hair     shaven off,
              my mind          entirely unbound,
              not adhering to people here.
              You ask me
              an inappropriate question
              about clan.”
              
                Sundarika:
                “But, sir, brahmans surely inquire of brahmans,
                ‘Are you among the brahmans?’”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “If you say you’re a brahman
                and I’m not a brahman,
                I ask you the three lines of the Sāvitti
                and its twenty-four syllables.”4
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “Because of what
                did seers, men, noble warriors, & brahmans
                —many of them here in the world—
                (first) arrange sacrifices to devas?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whoever has attained the end,
                an attainer-of-knowledge,
                should receive an oblation
                at the time of a sacrifice,
                his (sacrifice), I say, would succeed.”5
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “So yes, our sacrifice will succeed
                for we have seen an attainer-of-knowledge like you.
                It’s from not seeing those like you
                that someone else eats the sacrificial cake.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Therefore, brahman,
                as you are seeking your benefit,
                approach and ask.
                Perhaps you may find here
                one at peace, with no anger,
                no desire, no affliction:
                one with good wisdom.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “I delight in sacrifice,
                I desire to sacrifice,
                but I don’t understand
                where a sacrifice succeeds.
                Teach me, sir. Tell me that.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “In that case, brahman, lend ear.
                I will teach you the Dhamma.
                Don’t inquire about birth.6
                Inquire about conduct.
                As from wood, a fire is born,7
                so a sage, even from lowly birth
                —steadfast, restrained
                through a sense of shame—
                becomes a thoroughbred.
              
              
                One tamed by truth,
                endowed with self-control,
                attained to the end of knowledge,
                having fulfilled the holy life:
                To him, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,8
                to him a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those with well-restrained minds,
                straight as a shuttle:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those devoid of passion,
                their faculties well-centered,
                released like the moon
                from the grasp of an eclipse:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Unattached, they wander in the world,
                always mindful,
                abandoning possessiveness:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Who, abandoning sensuality,
                wanders victorious,
                who knows the end
                of birth & death,
                totally unbound, cool
                as a pool of water:
                The Tathāgata deserves9
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Consonant among the consonant,
                far from the discordant,
                the Tathāgata of infinite discernment,
                not smeared here or beyond:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                In whom no deceptiveness dwells,
                no conceit,
                devoid of greed, un-
                possessive, un-
                desiring,
                his anger dispelled,
                his mind entirely unbound,
                a brahman who has abandoned
                the stain of grief:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                He has abandoned the homes of the mind,
                has
                no possessions at all,
                no clinging here or beyond:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Centered, he’s crossed
                over the flood,
                he knows the Dhamma
                through the highest view,
                effluents ended, bearing his last body:

                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Whose effluent of becoming
                and harsh speech
                are destroyed, finished, do not exist—
                he, an attainer-of-knowledge,
                everywhere totally released10:

                Gone beyond snares,
                for whom there are no snares,
                who, among those attached to conceit,
                is unattached to conceit,
                comprehending stress
                along with its field & its site11:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Independent of desire,
                seeing seclusion,12
                gone beyond the views known by others,
                who has
                no supports
                no mental objects13
                at all:

                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                In whom, having understood them,
                phenomena from high to low
                are destroyed, finished, do not exist14—
                at peace, released in the ending of clinging:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Seeing the end & ending
                of fetters & birth,
                having dispelled the path of passion
                without trace,
                pure, faultless, stainless, clear:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Who doesn’t contemplate
                self by means of self,15
                centered, straightened,
                steadfast in mind,16
                truly unperturbed,
                free from rigidity, free
                from doubt:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.
              
              
                Who has no conditions for delusion,
                with knowledge & vision of all phenomena
                he carries his last body,
                having attained the unexcelled
                self-awakening, auspicious—
                to that extent is the purity of a spirit17:
                The Tathāgata deserves
                the sacrificial cake.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “And may my offering
                be a true offering
                from having obtained
                an attainer-of-knowledge like you.
                As Brahmā is my witness,
                may the Blessed One accept,
                may the Blessed One eat,
                my sacrificial cake.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “What’s been chanted over with verses18
                shouldn’t be eaten by me.
                That’s not the nature, brahman,
                of one who’s seen rightly.
                What’s been chanted over with verses
                Awakened Ones reject.
                That being their Dhamma, brahman,
                this is their way of life.
                Serve with other food & drink
                a fully-perfected great seer,
                his effluents     ended,
                his anxiety     stilled,
                for that is the field
                for one looking for merit.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “It’s well, Blessed One, how I understand
                who should eat the offering of one like me,
                whom I should seek at the time of sacrifice
                having received your advice.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whose violence is fully gone,
                whose mind is     limpid,
                whose sloth is     dispelled
                —fully released from sensuality—
                one who has subdued boundaries,19
                a master of birth & death,
                a sage consummate in sagacity20:
                When one like this has come to the sacrifice,
                then, subduing scorn, with hands palm-to-palm
                over the heart,
                do homage.
                Worship him with food & drink.
                In this way the offerings will succeed.”
              
              
                Sundarika:
                “Master, the Awakened One,
                field of merit
                unexcelled          in all the world,
                recipient          for all the world21
                deserves          the sacrificial cake.
                A gift given to you, master,
                bears great fruit.
              
            
            Then the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One, “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in Master Gotama’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance (into the Bhikkhu Saṅgha).”
            Then the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sundarika Bhāradvāja became another one of the arahants.
            vv. 456–486",Another version of this encounter is recorded in SN 7:9.,"s
              1. The account in SN 7:9 goes immediately from this question to the Buddha’s response marked by footnote 6.
              2. See AN 4:36.
              3. According to SnA, the “clan” of the run-of-the-mill is the five aggregates. However, the clan of run-of-the-mill people might also refer to the customs of all lineages that don’t follow the customs of the noble lineage set out in AN 4:28. 
              4. This is apparently a reference to Ṛgveda iii, 62, 10, an invocation addressed to Sāvitrī, or the Sun: 
              
                tat savitur vareṇ(i)yaṁ
                bhargo devasya dhīmahi
                dhiyo yo nah pracodayāt
                
                  “Let us meditate on the glory
                  of the excellent deva Sāvitrī,
                  that he may inspire our thoughts.” 
                
              
              This verse, in the Gāvitrī meter, is recited during the upanayana ceremony, when a young brahman is invested with the sacred thread that initiates him into the status of a “twice-born” brahman and he begins his study of the Vedas. Although similar passages were recited when young men of other castes began their education, Ṛgveda iii, 62, 10 was reserved exclusively for brahmans. It was also the subject of many meditations on its esoteric meaning, some of which can be found in the major Upaniṣads: Bṛhad-āraṇyaka 6.3.6; śvetāśvatara 4.18; and Maitrī 6.7 and 6.34.
              SnA suggests that the Buddha’s question about this verse surprises Sundarika, making him suspect that the Buddha knows more about brahmanical lore than he does, which is why he changes his tone with the following question. SnA also asserts that the Buddhist equivalent to the Sāvitti—three lines, 24 syllables—is the expression of homage to the Triple Gem: Buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi, Dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi, Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.
              5. In other words, the original motivation for performing sacrifices was that the recipient of the oblation would be a pure person. The Buddha gives another answer to a very similar question in Sn 5:3.
              6. In SN 7:9, the Buddha’s initial response to Sundarika begins here.
              7. SnA explains this analogy by saying that it doesn’t matter what kind of wood is used to make a fire, for in each case the fire is equally hot and bright. See MN 93.
              8. In SN 7:9, the initial exchange between the Buddha and Sundarika ends here. Sundarika then offers the sacrificial cake to the Buddha, who refuses it with the passage beginning with the line marked by footnote 18. Then, as in Sn 1:4, he tells Sundarika to throw away the offering, which sizzles in the water into which it is thrown. Shocked, Sundarika returns to the Buddha, who teaches him five more verses of Dhamma.
              
                Don’t, brahman, when lighting kindling,
                imagine that purity comes from that outside,
                for the skilled say that purity doesn’t come through that:
                whoever searches outside for purity.
                Having abandoned the lighting of kindling, I,
                brahman, ignite just the inner fire.
                Constantly afire,
                constantly centered in mind,
                I am a worthy one, living the holy life.
                Conceit, brahman, is the burden on your shoulder,
                anger your smoke, false speech your ashes.
                The tongue is the ladle;
                the heart, the fire-altar;
                the well-tamed self
                is the fire of a man.
                The Dhamma is a lake
                whose ford is virtue
                —limpid, praised by the good
                to the good—
                where attainers-of-knowledge, having bathed
                cross, dry-limbed,
                to the further shore.
                Truth, Dhamma, restraint, the holy life,
                attainment of Brahmā dependent on the middle:
                Pay homage to those who’ve become
                truly straightened:
                That, I call a man
                in the flow of the Dhamma.
              
              After hearing these verses, Sundarika asks for Acceptance into the Saṅgha, and the sutta concludes in the same way as the account given here.
              9. This is a play on words: arahati, “deserves,” is related to arahant.
              10. On the implications of being “everywhere released,” see The Paradox of Becoming, chapter 7.
              11. According to SnA, the field and site of stress is a reference to defilements. It could also be a reference to the objects of clinging that can form a basis for stress: such things as the aggregates, sense media, and properties (dhātu).
              12. According to SnA, “seclusion” here means unbinding. See SN 21:10 and SN 35:63. 
              13. Supports/mental objects = ārammaṇā. See Ud 8:1, SN 12:64, and SN 22:53.
              14. On unbinding as the end of phenomena, see AN 10:58 and Sn 5:6.
              15. For examples of seeing self by means of self (or self by means of not-self, or not-self by means of self), see MN 2.
              16. This verse contains a play on words, in that attā can mean both “self” and “mind,” and it is used in both senses here.
              17. Spirit = yakkha. According to SnA, the word yakkha in this context means “person.” See Sn 4:11, note 4.
              18. See Sn 1:4.
              19. Boundaries = sīmantā. According to SnA, this is an epithet for defilement, in that the territory (sīmā) stands for good manners, and the end of the territory, or boundary, (sīmanta) stands for the defilements that lie outside of the realm of good manners. For a very different meaning for “territory,” see Sn 4:4, note 12.
              20. See AN 3:123 and Sn 1:12.
              21. The word, sabba-lokasmiṁ—”in all the world,” “with regard to all the world”—apparently functions as a lamp in this verse.",: SN 3:24; AN 6:37; AN 9:20
Sn 3:5  Māgha,Sn 3:5,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_5.html,Sn 3:5  Māgha  —  What are the qualities of a recipient that produce the most merit from a gift?,"KN/Sn/3:5
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain. Then the young brahman Māgha went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Master Gotama, I am generous, a master of giving, magnanimous, responsive to requests. I search for wealth righteously. Having searched for wealth righteously, then—with wealth righteously gained, righteously acquired—I give to one, I give to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, and to more. Thus giving, thus sacrificing, do I produce much merit?”
            “Certainly, young man, thus giving, thus sacrificing, you produce much merit. Anyone who is generous, a master of giving, magnanimous, responsive to requests, who searches for wealth righteously and, having searched for wealth righteously, then—with wealth righteously gained, righteously acquired—gives to one, to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, and to more, produces much merit.”
            Then the young brahman Māgha addressed the Blessed One in verse:
            
              “I ask the magnanimous Gotama,
              wearing ochre robes, wandering without home:
              When a householder responsive to requests,
              a master of giving,
              makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
              looking for merit,
              giving food & drink to others here,
              how is the offering purified
              for the one making the sacrifice?”
              
                The Buddha:
                “When a householder responsive to requests,
                a master of giving,
                makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
                looking for merit,
                giving food & drink to others here:
                Such a person achieves his aim
                in terms of the recipient.”
              
              
                Māgha:
                “When a householder responsive to requests,
                a master of giving,
                makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
                looking for merit,
                giving food & drink to others here:
                Point out to me the recipient.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Those who, unadhering,1
                wander in the world, having nothing,
                fully accomplished, their minds restrained:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those who have cut all fetters & bonds,
                tamed, released, with
                no afflictions,
                no desires:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to them a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.
              
              
                Those released from all fetters & bonds,
                tamed, released, with
                no afflictions,
                no desires:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Having abandoned
                passion, aversion, & delusion,
                their holy life fulfilled,
                their effluents ended:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those in whom no deceptiveness dwells,
                no conceit,
                their holy life fulfilled,
                their effluents ended:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those devoid of greed,
                unpossessive, undesiring,
                their holy life fulfilled,
                their effluents ended:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those who aren’t prey to cravings,
                who wander without possessiveness,
                having crossed over the flood:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those who, having abandoned sensuality,
                wander without home,
                their minds well-restrained,
                straight as a shuttle:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Those devoid of passion,
                their faculties well-centered,
                released like the moon
                from the grasp of an eclipse:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Having calmed themselves,
                those devoid of passion, unprovoked,
                who have no (future) destinations,
                having abandoned them here:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                Having abandoned birth & death
                without trace,
                they have escaped all perplexity:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                They who, with themselves as refuge,
                wander in the world,
                having nothing, everywhere released:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                They who know here, as it really is—
                ‘This is the last birth,
                there is no further becoming’:
                To them, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering.
              
              
                An attainer-of-knowledge,2
                delighting in jhāna, mindful,
                attained to self-awakening,
                the refuge of many:
                To him, at the right time,
                you should bestow an offering,
                to him a brahman aiming at merit
                should sacrifice.”
                
              
              
                Māgha:
                “Yes, my question was not in vain.
                You, Blessed One, have pointed out the recipient.
                You know this here, as it really is,
                because this Dhamma has been experienced by you.
                When a householder responsive to requests,
                a master of giving,
                makes a sacrifice in hopes of merit,
                looking for merit,
                giving food & drink to others here:
                Point out to me, Blessed One,
                the consummation of the sacrifice.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Sacrifice, and while sacrificing, Māgha,
                said the Blessed One,
                make your mind clear          everywhere.
                For one sacrificing, the sacrifice is the object,
                the support.3
                Taking a stand there, he abandons faults.4
                He—devoid of passion, subduing aversion,
                developing a mind of goodwill
                immeasurable,
                day & night, continually heedful—
                should pervade all the directions
                immeasurably.”
              
              
                Māgha:
                “Who is purified? Released? Bound?
                By means of what mind does one go
                to the Brahmā world?
                Say this, sage, when asked
                by me who doesn’t know.
                As the Blessed One is my witness,
                I have seen Brahmā today,
                for you are equal to Brahmā for us—it’s true!
                How, shining one, does one reappear
                in the Brahmā world?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Whoever sacrifices
                with the threefold sacrifice consummation,5
                such a one would achieve his aim
                in terms of the recipient.
                Having thus sacrificed rightly,
                one responsive to requests
                reappears, I say, in the Brahmā world.”5
              
            
            When this was said, the young brahman Māgha said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”

              1. Reading alaggā with the Thai edition. The Burmese and PTS editions read asattā, “without attachment.”
              2. In this verse, the Buddha is referring to himself.
              3. Support/object = ārammaṇaṁ.
              4. Dosa. There is apparently a play on words in this verse, with dosa meaning “fault” here, and “aversion” in the next line.
              5. According to SnA, the threefold consummation of the sacrifice refers to the three qualities of the donor mentioned in AN 6:37: “The donor, before giving, is glad; while giving, his/her mind is bright & clear; and after giving, is gratified.” However, because these qualities are not mentioned in this sutta, this explanation is unlikely. It’s more likely that the Buddha here is referring to the three points he made just above: that the donor should make his/her mind clear; should abandon the faults of passion and aversion; and should develop immeasurable thoughts of goodwill. For more on the development of immeasurable goodwill and its benefits, see MN 97, AN 4:125–126, AN 10:196, and AN 11:16.",: SN 3:24; SN 20:4; AN 5:53; AN 6:37; AN 8:54; AN 9:20; Iti 22; Iti 27; Iti 100
Sn 3:6  Sabhiya,Sn 3:6,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_6.html,"Sn 3:6  Sabhiya  —  A sutta dating from early in the Buddha’s teaching career. A wanderer, disappointed in the teachings he has received from other teachers, approaches the Buddha with his questions.","KN/Sn/3:6
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now on that occasion, questions had been assigned to Sabhiya the wanderer by a devatā who was a former relative of his: “Sabhiya, if any contemplative or brahman, when asked these questions, answers them, live the holy life in his presence.” Then Sabhiya the wanderer, having learned these questions in the presence of that devatā, went to those who had communities & groups, who were the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta, & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—and asked them the questions. But they, being asked the questions by Sabhiya the wanderer, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turned the questions back on Sabhiya the wanderer.
            The thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “These venerable contemplatives & brahmans with communities & groups, who are the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa … & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—when asked these questions by me are unable to answer. Unable to answer, they show anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turn the questions back on me. What if I were to revert to the lower life and partake of sensual pleasures?”
            But then the thought occurred to him, “There is still this Gotama the contemplative. He has a community & group, he is the teacher of a group, well-known, prestigious, founder of a sect, well-regarded by people at large. What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?”
            Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “Now, those venerable contemplatives & brahmans—Pūraṇa Kassapa … & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—are old, elderly, aged, along in their years, at an advanced stage of life, elders, senior, long gone forth, with communities & groups, teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large: Even they, when asked these questions by me, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turned the questions back on me. So how could this Gotama the contemplative answer when asked these questions? He is both young in age and newly gone forth.”
            But then the thought occurred to him, “Gotama the contemplative is not to be despised as ‘young’ or treated with contempt. Even though young, he is of great power & great might.1 What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?”
            So Sabhiya the wanderer set out, headed for Rājagaha. Wandering by stages, he arrived at where the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:
            
              “Doubtful & uncertain, I have come
              desiring to ask questions.
              Put an end to them,
              when asked them by me.
              Answer me     one-by-one,
              in line with the Dhamma.”
              
                “Sabhiya,” said the Blessed One,
                “you have come from afar,
                desiring to ask questions.
                I will put an end to them,
                when asked them by you.
                I will answer you     one-by-one,
                in line with the Dhamma.”
              
            
            Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “Isn’t is amazing? Isn’t it astounding?—how even the leave, of which I didn’t receive even a little bit from other contemplatives & brahmans, has been granted to me by Gotama the contemplative.” Gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, & happy, he asked the Blessed One a question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be a monk?
              In what way is one composed?
              And how is one said to be tamed?
              How is one called ‘awakened’?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having gone to total unbinding,
                having crossed over doubt,
                by means of the path accomplished by himself,
                having abandoned becoming & non-becoming,
                having fulfilled [the task],
                further-becoming ended:
                He is a monk.2
              
              
                Everywhere equanimous, mindful,
                he harms no one in all the world.
                A contemplative crossed over, limpid,
                he has no swellings3: He is composed.
              
              
                Whose faculties are developed,
                within & without,
                with regard to all the world,4
                disenchanted with this world & the next,
                he awaits his time,5 developed: He’s tamed.
              
              
                Having evaluated all theories,
                the wandering-on,
                dying & reappearing,
                having done away with dust & blemish
                —pure—
                he has attained the ending of birth:
                He is called awakened.”6
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be a brahman?
              In what way is one a contemplative,
              and how is one ‘washed’?
              How is one called a nāga?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having banished all evils,7
                well-centered, stainless,
                firm in mind,
                gone entirely          beyond
                the wandering-on,
                independent, Such:
                He’s called a brahman.
              
              
                Calmed, having abandoned
                good & evil,
                dustless, having known
                this world & the next,
                gone beyond birth & death,
                he is truly called a contemplative8—
                Such.
              
              
                Having washed off     all evils
                within & without, in     all the world,
                with regard to the theories
                of beings human & divine,
                he goes to no theory:
                He’s said to be ‘washed.’9
              
              
                He does no misdeed10
                at all in the world.
                Having escaped all fetters & bonds,
                freed, he’s everywhere un-
                attached,
                truly he’s called a nāga—
                Such.”
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Whom do the awakened
              call a field-victor?
              In what way is one skilled
              and how is one wise?
              And how is one called
              by the name of ‘sage’?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having examined all fields11—
                heavenly, human, and fields of the Brahmās—
                freed from the root bonds of all fields,
                he’s truly called a field-victor—
                Such.
              
              
                Having examined all storehouses12—
                heavenly, human, storehouses of Brahmās—
                freed from the root bonds of all storehouses,
                he’s truly called skillful—
                Such.
              
              
                Having examined all white flowers13
                within & without,
                one of pure discernment
                gone beyond dark & bright,
                he’s truly called wise—
                Such.
              
              
                Knowing false & true Dhamma
                within & without, in all the world,
                he is worshipped by beings
                human & divine.
                Having transcended snares & nets,
                he is a sage.”
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be
              an attainer-of-knowledge?
              In what way is one well-tested,
              and how is one persistent?
              Why is one named a thoroughbred?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having examined all knowledges—
                those of brahmans, those of contemplatives—
                devoid of passion for all feelings,14
                gone beyond knowledge:
                He’s an attainer-of-knowledge.
              
              
                Having tested objectification15
                & name-&-form,
                within & without, the root of disease,
                freed from the root bond of disease,
                he’s truly called well-tested—
                Such.
              
              
                Abstaining from all evils,
                gone beyond the suffering of hell,
                he’s one with persistence.
                He, with persistence, exertion,
                is rightly called a hero16—
                Such.
              
              
                One truly whose bonds are cut
                within & without,
                freed from all the root bonds of snares,
                truly he’s called a thoroughbred—
                Such.”
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:
            
              “Having attained what
              is one said to be learned?
              In what way is one noble,
              and how is one a person of good conduct?
              Why is one named a wanderer?
              Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”
              
                The Buddha:
                “Having heard, having directly known
                every Dhamma
                for the sake of direct knowing17
                in the world,
                whatever is blameworthy or blameless,
                having conquered, free of doubt,
                released
                everywhere, everywhere
                without trouble,
                one is said to be learned.18
              
              
                Having cut attachments & effluents,
                knowing, he does not come to lie in the womb,
                dispelling mud
                and the three types of perception,19
                he goes to no theory:
                He is called noble.
              
              
                Whoever here has attained attainment
                with regard to good conduct,
                all-skillful, who has learned the Dhamma,
                unattached
                everywhere,
                everywhere his mind released,
                he has no irritation:
                He is one of good conduct.
              
              
                Avoiding whatever action there is
                that ripens in suffering & stress
                —above, below, and even all around
                in the middle—
                one who goes about, comprehending,
                he has put an all-around end to
                deceptiveness, conceit,
                greed, anger,
                name-&-form:
                He’s called a wanderer,
                attained to attainment.”20
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy—got up from his seat and, arranging his upper robe over his shoulder and placing his hands palm-to-palm over his heart toward the Blessed One, praised the Blessed One face-to-face with fitting verses:
            
              “One Deeply Discerning,
              you have crossed over the flood of darkness
              of the three & sixty views leading downward,21
              dependent on the teachings of contemplatives,
              dependent on perceptions
              & words of perceptions.
              You have gone     to the end,
              you have gone     to the further shore
              of suffering & stress.
              You are a noble one,
              rightly self-awakened.
              I would imagine that you
              have ended the effluents.
              Brilliant, thoughtful,
              of abundant discernment,
              ender of suffering,
              you have brought me across.
              
                When you learned of my doubt,
                you brought me across my uncertainty.
                Homage to you, sage attained
                to the attainment of sagacity’s ways.
                Free from rigidity, Kinsman of the Sun,
                you’re composed.
              
              
                The doubt I had before,
                you have answered, One with Eyes.
                Yes, you are a sage, rightly
                self-awakened. You have
                no hindrances. Your despairs
                are fallen down, cut from the stem.
                Cooled, attained to self-control,
                steadfast, enduring in truth:
                In your words, Nāga of nāgas, great hero,
                all devas—including Nāradas and Pabbatas22—
                delight.
                Homage to you, O thoroughbred man,
                Homage to you, O superlative man,23
                in the world with its devas
                there’s no one to compare with you.24
                You : Awakened.
                You : Teacher.
                You : Sage who has conquered Māra.
                You : Having cut obsessions,
                having crossed over,
                bring this generation across.
                Your acquisitions transcended,
                your effluents torn apart,
                you are a lion
                free of clinging,
                your fear & terror abandoned.
                As a lovely lotus
                is not smeared by water,
                you are not smeared
                by good or evil.
              
              
                Extend your feet, hero:
                Sabhiya venerates them,
                the feet of the Teacher.25
              
            
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer, bending his head to the Blessed One’s feet, said, “Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance.”
            “Anyone, Sabhiya, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the Going-forth & Acceptance into this Dhamma & Vinaya, must first undergo probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks feel so moved, they give him the Going-forth & accept him into the monk’s state. But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter.”
            “Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end of four years, the monks feel so moved, let them give me the Going-forth & accept me into the monk’s state.”
            Then Sabhiya the wanderer obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sabhiya became another one of the arahants.

              2. Many of the Buddha’s answers to Sabhiya’s questions involve verbal effects such as alliteration and rhyme. This verse contains a play on words, relating bhikkhu (monk) to bhavaṁ (becoming) and khīṇa- (ended).
              3. Ussada: According to SnA, this means such forms of defilement as passion, aversion, delusion, pride, and conceit. See Sn 4:14.
              4. In other words, one who is dispassionate to the sense faculties and their objects. See SN 35:153.
              5. This is a reference to an image more fully elaborated in Thag 11 and Thag 14:1:
              
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time
                as a worker his wage.
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time,
                mindful, alert.
              
              6. This verse contains an end-rhyme—visuddhaṁ/Buddhaṁ—which is rare in Pali poetry.
              7. Here there is alliteration between bāhetvā (banished) and brahmā (brahman, shortened to fit the meter). A similar alliteration is found in Dhp 388 and Ud 1:4–5.
              8. Here there is alliteration between samitāvi (calmed) and samaṇo (contemplative).
              9. Here there is alliteration between n’eti, “doesn’t come/go” and nhātako, “washed.” This verse also contains a play on words. Normally, one would say that a person is washed of dirt (uklāpa); here the arahant is said to be washed of theory (kappa).
              10. The Pali phrase here is āguṁ na karoti, which could be rephrased as na āguṁ karoti, yielding a play on the word nāga. The same play on words is found in AN 6:43. Given that one of the meanings of nāga is “large elephant,” the verse here further elaborates on the image evoked by the word by depicting the nāga as freed from all fetters and bonds.
              11. SnA cites this passage from AN 3:77 to identify “field,” here, with kamma: “Kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture.” In the context of that sutta, this analogy is used to explain the way different levels of becoming are produced.
              12. As with “field,” SnA identifies “storehouses” as storehouses of kamma. Here there is alliteration between kosāni (storehouses) and kusalo (skillful).
              13. Paṇḍara = Pāṇdura (Skt.): Anogeissus Latifolia. According to SnA, “white flowers” stands for the six sense media, in that they are normally pure and yet can grow (see SN 22:54). An alternative possibility is that “white flowers” stands for states of mind marked by a perception of whiteness—such as the white-totality, and the mastery described in AN 10:29 as follows: 
              

                “One percipient of the formless internally sees forms externally as white, white in their color, white in their features, white in their glow. Just as the morning star is white, white in its color, white in its features, white in its glow, or just as Vārāṇasī muslin, smooth on both sides, is white, white in its color, white in its features, white in its glow, in the same way one percipient of the formless internally sees forms externally as white, white in their color, white in their features, white in their glow. Mastering them, he is percipient of ‘I know; I see.’”
              
              As AN 10:29 further notes, this is the highest state of mastery, “yet even in the beings who are percipient in this way there is still aberration, there is change. Seeing this, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with that. Being disenchanted with that, he becomes dispassionate toward what is supreme, and even more so toward what is inferior.” As the verse here notes, a person going beyond this state would have to go beyond all states of darkness and brightness to attain release.
              This verse contains an alliteration that can, without force, be replicated in English: white flowers (paṇdarāni) and wise (paṇdito).
              14. Here there is a play on words with vedāni (knowledges) and vedanā (feelings).
              15. See MN 18, introduction.
              16. Reading vīro with GD, rather than dhīro, which is found in the printed editions but doesn’t seem to fit the context. (See the note in GD to verse 44 in Sn 1:3, which comments on the tendency of the textual tradition to confuse these two words.) This reading would give the verse three alliterated words: virato (abstaining), viriyavā (one with persistence), and vīro (hero).
              17. “Having directly known, for the sake of direct knowing”: Two meanings of the word abhiññāya.
              18. Here there is an alliteration between sutavā (having heard) and sottiyo (learned). 
              19. SnA identifies “mud” as the strings of sensuality, and the three types of perception as the three beginning with the perception of sensuality. These could be either the perceptions of sensuality, ill-will, and harmfulness, or the perceptions of sensuality, form, and formlessness.
              The alliteration in this verse is between ālayāni (attachments) and ariyo (noble).
              20. This verse contains an alliteration between paribbājayitvā (avoiding) and paribbājaka (wanderer).
              21. According to SnA, the 63 wrong views comprise the 62 wrong views mentioned in DN 1 along with the wrong view of self-identity (sakkāya-diṭṭhi).
              22. According to SnA, these are classes of devas noted for their discernment.
              23. See AN 11:10.
              24. See Iti 112.

            I have heard that on one occasion, while the Blessed One was wandering on a tour among the Aṅguttarāpans with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all, he arrived at an Aṅguttarāpan town named Āpaṇa. Keṇiya the coiled hair ascetic heard it said, “Gotama the contemplative—a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan—on a wandering tour among the Aṅguttarāpans with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all—has arrived at Āpaṇa. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: ‘He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed. He makes known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives & brahmans, its rulers & commonfolk; he explains the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; he expounds the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.’”
            So Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side.1 As he was sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged him with a talk on Dhamma. Then Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic—instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged with the Blessed One’s talk on Dhamma—said to him, “Master Gotama, may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of monks.”
            When this was said, the Blessed One said to him, “The Saṅgha of monks is large, Keṇiya, approximately 1,250 monks in all, and you are strongly confident in brahmans.”
            A second time… A third time, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic said to the Blessed One, “Master Gotama, even though the Saṅgha of monks is large, approximately 1,250 monks in all, and I am strongly confident in brahmans, may Master Gotama acquiesce to my meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of monks.”
            The Blessed One acquiesced with silence.
            Then Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, understanding the Blessed One’s acquiescence, got up from his seat and returned to his own ashram. On arrival, he addressed his friends & companions, his relatives & kinsmen: “Listen to me, venerable friends & companions, relatives & kinsmen: I have invited Gotama the contemplative together with a Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all, for the meal tomorrow. Give me bodily assistance for that.”
            “As you say, master,” his friends & companions, relatives & kinsmen responded to him. Some of them dug out ovens, some split wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water pot, some arranged seats, while Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic arranged a pavilion of garlands himself.
            Now on that occasion Sela the brahman was staying at Āpaṇa. He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, etymology, & histories as a fifth; skilled in philology & grammar, he was fully versed in cosmology and in the marks of a Great Man. He was instructing 300 young brahmans in the (Vedic) mantras. Then, as he—surrounded by 300 young brahmans—was walking and wandering about to exercise his legs, he arrived at the ashram of Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic. He saw that some of the people in the ashram were digging out ovens, some were splitting wood… while Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic was arranging a pavilion of garlands himself. On seeing this, he said to Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, “Could it be that Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic is giving a son or daughter in marriage, or is he setting up a great sacrifice, or is Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, invited for tomorrow together with his army?”
            “No, Sela, it’s not that I’m giving a son or daughter in marriage, nor that Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, is invited for tomorrow together with his army. But I am setting up a great sacrifice. There is Gotama the contemplative—a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan—who, on a wandering tour among the Aṅguttarāpans with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 1,250 monks in all, has arrived at Āpaṇa. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: ‘He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.’ He has been invited by me for the meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of monks.”
            “Did you say, ‘Awakened,’ master Keṇiya?”
            “I said, ‘Awakened,’ master Sela.”
            “Did you say, ‘Awakened,’ master Keṇiya?”
            “I said, ‘Awakened,’ master Sela.”
            Then the thought occurred to Sela the brahman, “Even just this word is hard to come by in the world: ‘Awakened.’ Now, these 32 marks of a Great Man have come down in our mantras. For a Great Man endowed with them, two future courses, and no other, exist. If he inhabits a home, he will become a wheel-turning king, righteous, a king through righteousness, a conqueror of the four quarters, a stabilizer of his countryside endowed with the seven treasures. The seven treasures are these: the wheel-treasure, the elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the woman-treasure, the householder-treasure, and the adviser-treasure as the seventh. He will have a thousand sons, valiant, heroic in body, crushers of enemy armies. He will dwell, having conquered the earth to the edge of the sea, by means of Dhamma, without rod, without sword. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he will become a worthy one, rightly self-awakened, with his roof opened in the world.”2
            “Master Keṇiya, where is he staying now, that Master Gotama, worthy & rightly self-awakened?”
            When this was said, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic lifted his right arm and said to Sela the brahman, “There, by the dark green line of the forest.”
            Then Sela the brahman, together with the 300 young brahmans, headed toward the Blessed One. Then he addressed the young brahmans, “Come noiselessly, masters, placing a footstep in a footstep. These Blessed Ones are hard to approach, like a lion wandering alone. And when I engage Gotama the contemplative in counsel, don’t break into the middle of my talk. Wait until the end of my talk.”
            Then Sela the brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he looked for the 32 marks of a Great Man in the Blessed One’s body. He saw most of the 32 marks of a Great Man in the Blessed One’s body, except for two. About the two marks he was doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and wasn’t reassured: about the male organ being in a sheath, and about the size of the tongue.
            The thought occurred to the Blessed One, “Sela the brahman sees most of my marks of a Great Man, except for two. About the two marks he is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and isn’t reassured: about the male organ being in a sheath, and about the size of the tongue.” So the Blessed One willed a willing of power such that Sela the brahman saw that the Blessed One’s male organ was in a sheath. And then, extending his tongue, the Blessed One licked both ear-holes and nostrils back and forth, and covered his whole forehead with his tongue.
            The thought occurred to Sela the brahman, “Gotama the contemplative’s 32 marks of a Great Man are complete and not incomplete. But I don’t know whether he is awakened or not. Still, I have heard the aged line of teachers, along in their years, say that Blessed Ones, worthy & rightly self-awakened, reveal themselves when their praise is spoken. What if I were to praise Gotama the contemplative face-to-face with fitting verses?”
            So Sela the brahman praised the Blessed One face-to-face with fitting verses:
            
              “Perfect your body, shining well,
              well-born, lovely to look at,
              Blessed One, you have a golden complexion,
              you have white teeth, you’re vigorous.
              The characteristics of a well-born man,
              the marks of a Great Man,
              are all present in your body.
              Clear your eyes, good your face,
              imposing, splendid, straight upright:
              In the midst
              of a community of contemplatives
              you shine like the sun.
              A monk with skin resembling gold
              is admirable to look at,
              but what use is the contemplative state
              for you, so superlative in appearance?
              You deserve to be a king,
              a wheel-turner,3 lord of charioteers,
              conqueror of the four quarters,
              sovereign lord of the Jambu grove.4
              Noble warriors, feudal lords, & kings
              are your devotees.
              King of kings, monarch of human beings:
              Rule, Gotama!”
              
                The Buddha:
                “I am a king, Sela:
                a Dhamma king unexcelled.
                I turn the wheel with Dhamma—
                the wheel whose turning
                can’t be stopped.”
              
              
                Sela:
                “You claim to be rightly self-awakened,
                a Dhamma king unexcelled.
                But who, master, is your general,
                the disciple right below the teacher?
                Who keeps rolling
                the Dhamma-wheel set rolling by you?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “The wheel set rolling by me
                the unexcelled Dhamma-wheel:
                Sāriputta keeps it rolling
                taking after the Tathāgata.5
                What should be directly known
                has been directly known,
                what should be developed, developed,
                what should be abandoned, abandoned6:
                Therefore, I’m awakened, brahman.
                Subdue your doubt about me.
                Be decided, brahman.
                It’s hard often to gain
                sight of the Rightly Self-Awakened.
                I am one
                whose appearance in the world
                is hard often to gain:
                Rightly Self-Awakened,
                an arrow-remover unexcelled.
                Brahmā-become, without compare,
                crusher of Māra’s armies,
                having overmastered all enemies,
                I rejoice, with no fear
                from anywhere.”
              
              
                Sela (to his following):
                “Observe carefully, masters,
                how he speaks, this One with Eyes,
                arrow-remover, great hero:
                He roars like a lion in the forest.
                Brahmā-become, without compare,
                crusher of Māra’s armies:
                Who,
                even one of a dark birth,7
                on seeing him,
                would not have confidence?
                Whoever wants to     may follow me.
                Whoever doesn’t     may go.
                I will here go forth
                in the presence of the one
                of foremost discernment.”
              
              
                Sela’s following:
                “If, master, you thus delight
                in the message
                of the Rightly Self-Awakened One,
                we, too, will here go forth
                in the presence of the one
                of foremost discernment.”
              
              
                Sela:
                “These three hundred brahmans
                request, with hands palm-to-palm
                over the heart:
                We will follow the holy-life,
                Blessed One, in your presence.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “The holy-life is well-expounded,
                to be seen here-&-now, timeless,
                where the Going-forth is not in vain
                for a heedful person who trains.”
              
            
            Then Sela the brahman, together with his following, obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance.
            Then, as the night was ending, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, having had choice staple & non-staple foods prepared in his own ashram, announced the time to the Blessed One, “It is time, master Gotama. The meal is ready.”
            Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One—after adjusting his lower robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe—went together with a Saṅgha of monks to Keṇiya’s ashram. On arrival, he sat down on an arranged seat. Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic, with his own hand, served & satisfied the Blessed One & the Saṅgha of monks with choice staple & non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had rinsed his bowl & hands, Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic took a lower seat and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One expressed approval of him with these verses:
            
              “The fire oblation is the chief of sacrifices,
              the Sāvitti,     the chief of Vedic hymns,8
              a king,          chief among human beings,
              the ocean,     chief among rivers,
              the moon,     chief of the zodiac stars,
              the sun,          chief of things that burn,9
              and for those who sacrifice, wishing for merit,
              the Saṅgha, truly,
              is chief.
            
            Then, having expressed approval of Keṇiya the coiled-hair ascetic with these verses, the Blessed One got up from his seat and left.
            Then Ven. Sela, together with his following—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sela, together with his following, became another one of the arahants.
            Then Ven. Sela, together with his following, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and extending his hands palm-to-palm over the heart toward the Blessed One, addressed him in verse:
            
              “This is the eighth day
              since coming for refuge,
              One with Eyes.
              Blessed One,
              for seven nights,
              we have tamed ourselves
              with your message.
              You : Awakened.
              You : Teacher.
              You : Sage who has conquered Māra.
              You : Having cut obsessions,
              having crossed over,
              bring this generation across.
              Your acquisitions transcended,
              your effluents torn apart,
              you are a lion
              free of clinging,
              your fear & terror abandoned.
              These three hundred monks
              stand with hands palm-to-palm
              over the heart.
              Extend your feet, hero:
              The nāgas venerate them,
              the feet of the Teacher.”10
            
            vv. 548–573", (This sutta is identical with MN 92. Part of it also appears in Mv VI.35.1–8.),"s
              1. According to Mv VI.35.3, at this point in the narrative Keṇiya offered a juice drink to the Buddha, who told him also to offer the drink to the Saṅgha. This became the occasion for the allowance for monks to consume juice drinks after noon.
              2. See Sn 1:2, note 3.
              3. To be a wheel-turner meant, in ancient Indian parlance, to establish rule over the entire “wheel” of the eight directions. The sutta containing the Buddha’s first sermon (SN 56:11), in stating that the sermon set the Dhamma-wheel rolling, thus borrowed this image to make the point that the Buddha’s Dhamma ruled in all directions.
              The Dhamma-wheel is also a wheel in another sense. In ancient Indian texts, a “wheel” was a list of a permutations of two or more variables. The Dhamma-wheel in the Buddha’s first sermon lists all twelve permutations of two variables: the four noble truths—stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation—and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed.
              4. An epithet for the Indian subcontinent.
              5. See MN 141. MLDB, in its translation of this verse in MN 92, mistakenly says that Sāriputta will keep the Dhamma wheel rolling; GD mistakenly identifies him as the Buddha’s successor, rather than as the disciple right below him. Translations of this sort have led at least one scholar to cite this verse as a late addition to the Canon, in conflict with MN 108, which clearly states that the Buddha left no successor, and with SN 47:13, which notes that Sāriputta passed away before the Buddha. However, when the verse is correctly translated, there is no conflict. 
              6. Three of the four duties with regard to the four noble truths. See SN 56:11 and MN 149.
              7. Sela, despite his newfound confidence in the Buddha, has not yet abandoned his racism. In AN 4:85, however, the Buddha redefines the brahmanical concept of dark birth in such a way that is based on kamma rather than race.
              8. Chandas. This term normally means “meter,” but it also means Vedic hymn. See the discussion in The Buddhist Monastic Code, volume II, chapter 8. On the Sāvitti as the chief Vedic hymn, see Sn 3:4, note 4.

              Without sign,
              unknown
              —the life here of mortals—
              difficult,
              short,
              tied up with pain.
              For there’s no way
              by which those who are born
              will not die.
              Beings are subject
              to death
              even when they attain
              old age.
              
                Like ripe fruits
                whose downfall, whose danger
                is falling,
                so for mortals, once born,
                the constant danger
                is death.
              
              
                As clay vessels made by a potter
                all end up broken,
                so too life
                heads to death.1
                Young & old
                wise & foolish:
                All
                come under the sway of death;
                all
                have death as their end.
              
              
                For those overcome by death,
                gone to the other world,
                father cannot shelter son,
                nor relatives a relative.
                See: Even while relatives are looking on,
                wailing heavily,
                mortals are
                one
                by
                one
                led away
                like cows to the slaughter.
                In this way is the world afflicted
                with aging & death,
                and so the enlightened don’t grieve,
                knowing the way of the world.
              
              
                “You don’t know the path
                of his coming or going:
                seeing neither end,
                you lament in vain.”2
              
              
                If, by lamenting,
                —confused,
                harming yourself—
                any use could be gained
                the prudent would do it as well.
                But not by weeping & grief
                do you gain peace of awareness.
                Pain
                arises all the more. Your body
                is harmed.
                You grow thin,
                pale,
                harming yourself
                by yourself.
                Not in that way
                are the dead protected.
                Lamentation’s in vain.
                Not abandoning grief, a person
                suffers all the more pain.
                Bewailing one whose time is done,
                you fall under the sway of grief.
              
              
                Look at others
                going along,
                people arriving
                in line with their actions:
                falling under the sway of death,
                beings simply
                shivering here.
              
              
                For however they imagine it,
                it always turns out
                other than that.
                That’s the type of (their) separation.
                See the way of the world.
              
              
                Even if a person lives a century
                —or more—
                he’s parted
                from his community of relatives,
                he abandons his life
                right here.
              
              
                So, having heard the arahant,
                subduing lamentation,
                seeing the dead one whose time is done,
                [think,] “I can’t fetch him back.”3
                Just as one would put out
                a burning refuge
                with water,
                so does the enlightened one—
                discerning,
                skillful,
                & wise—
                blow away any arisen grief,
                like the wind, a bit of cotton fluff.
              
              
                Seeking your own happiness,
                you should pull out your own arrow:
                your own
                lamentation,
                longing,
                & sorrow.4
                With arrow pulled out,
                independent,
                attaining peace of awareness,
                all grief transcended,
                griefless you are
                unbound.

                Just as one would put out
                a burning refuge
                with water,
                so does the enlightened one—
                discerning,
                skillful,
                & wise—
                blow away any arisen grief,
                his own lamentation, longing, & sorrow,
                like the wind, a bit of cotton fluff.
                Seeking your own happiness,
                you should pull out your own arrow.",: MN 82; MN 87; SN 21:2; SN 36:6; SN 47:13; AN 5:49; Ud 8:8; Thig 3:5; Thig 6:1
Sn 3:9  Vāseṭṭha,Sn 3:9,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_9.html,"Sn 3:9  Vāseṭṭha  —  Is one worthy of respect because of one’s birth, or because of one’s actions?","KN/Sn/3:9
           
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Icchānaṅgala in the Icchānaṅgala forest grove. And on that occasion many well-known wealthy brahmans were dwelling in Icchānaṅgala, i.e., Caṅkī the brahman, Tārukkha the brahman, Pokkharasāti the brahman, Jānusoṇin the brahman, Todeyya the brahman, and many other well-known wealthy brahmans.
            Then, while the young brahmans Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking and wandering about to exercise their legs, this conversation arose between them: “How is one a brahman?”
            The young brahman Bhāradvāja said, “When one is well-born on both sides, the mother’s & the father’s, is of pure descent for seven generations of fathers—uncriticized & irreproachable in the telling of one’s birth: It’s to that extent that one is a brahman.”
            The young brahman Vāseṭṭha said, “When one is virtuous & consummate in one’s practices, it’s to that extent that one is a brahman.”
            But neither was the young brahman Bhāradvāja able to win over the young brahman Vāseṭṭha, nor was the young brahman Vāseṭṭha able to win over the young brahman Bhāradvāja.
            Then the young brahman Vāseṭṭha said to the young brahman Bhāradvāja, “Bhāradvāja, this Gotama the contemplative—a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan—is staying at Icchānaṅgala in the Icchānaṅgala forest grove. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: ‘He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy & rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing & conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to Gotama the contemplative and, on arrival, ask him about this matter. However he answers, that’s how we’ll hold it.”
            “As you say, master,” the young brahman Bhāradvāja responded to the young brahman Vāseṭṭha. So the young brahmans Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, the young brahman Vāseṭṭha addressed the Blessed One in verses:
            
              Master, we’re acknowledged & self-proclaimed
              as masters of the three knowledges1:
              I, a student of Pokkharasāti,
              this one, of Tārukka.
              Whatever is taught
              by masters of the three knowledges,
              in that we are adept—
              grammarians & philologists,
              on a par with our teachers in recitation.
              
                We have a dispute, Gotama,
                on the topic of birth.
                Bhāradvāja says that one is a brahman
                through birth,
                I say through action.2
                Know this, One with Eyes.
                Neither of us can win over the other.
                We come, asking the master
                reputed to be self-awakened.
                As people going
                with hands palm-to-palm over the heart
                pay homage, venerating
                the moon when it’s just past new,
                in the same way in the world, Gotama,
                we ask Gotama, the Eye arisen in the world:
                Is one a brahman through birth
                or is it through action?
                Tell us, who don’t know,
                how we might know a brahman.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “I will answer you step-by-step
                as it really is.
                Animals are divided by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.3
                You know grasses & trees,
                even though they don’t proclaim themselves:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                Then beetles & moths, down to white ants:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                You know four-footed beasts,
                small & large:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                You know belly-footed, long-backed snakes:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                Then you know fish in the water, with water their range:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
                Then you know birds, with wings as their vehicles,
                coursing through the sky:
                Their distinguishing markings are made by nature,
                for their species differ, one from another.
              
              
                While these species
                have many distinguishing marks
                made by nature,
                human beings     don’t
                have many distinguishing marks
                made by nature:
                not through hair or head
                not through ears or eyes,
                not through face or nose,
                not through mouth or lips,
                not through neck or shoulders,
                not through belly or back,
                not through buttocks or chest,
                not through groin or intercourse,
                not through hands or feet,
                not through fingers or nails,
                not through calves or thighs,
                not through complexion or voice.
                Their distinguishing mark is not made by nature
                as it is for other species.
                In human beings that’s not found
                individually in their bodies,
                but their identification is described
                in terms of convention:
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living by guarding cows,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a farmer, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through various crafts,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a craftsman, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through trade,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a merchant, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living by serving others,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a servant, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through stealing,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha:
                This is a thief, not a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through arrow & sword,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a soldier, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living through priesthood,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a sacrificer, not as a brahman.
                Whoever, among human beings,
                makes a living partaking of city & state,
                you know him thus, Vāseṭṭha,
                as a king, not as a brahman.
              
              
                
                  I don’t call one a brahman
                  for being born of a mother
                  or sprung from a womb.
                  He’s called a ‘bho-sayer’
                  if he has anything at all.
                  But someone with nothing,
                  who clings to no thing:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.4
                  Having cut every fetter,
                  he doesn’t get ruffled.
                  Beyond attachment,
                  unshackled:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having cut the strap & thong,
                  cord & bridle,
                  having thrown off the bar,5
                  awakened:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He endures—unangered—
                  insult, assault, & imprisonment.
                  His army is strength;
                  his strength, forbearance:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Free from anger,
                  duties observed,
                  principled, with no overbearing pride,
                  trained, a ‘last-body’:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.6
                  Like water          on a lotus leaf,
                  a mustard seed     on the tip of an awl,
                  he doesn’t adhere     to sensual pleasures:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He discerns right here,
                  for himself,
                  on his own,
                  his own
                  ending of stress.7
                  Unshackled, his burden laid down:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Wise, deeply
                  discerning, astute
                  as to what is the path
                  & what’s not;
                  his ultimate goal attained:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Uncontaminated
                  by householders
                  & houseless ones alike;
                  living with no home,
                  with next to no wants:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having put aside violence
                  against beings fearful or firm,
                  he neither kills nor
                  gets others to kill:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Unopposing          among opposition,
                  unbound          among the armed,
                  unclinging          among those who cling:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  His passion, aversion,
                  conceit, & contempt,
                  have fallen away—
                  like a mustard seed
                  from the tip of an awl:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He would say
                  what’s
                  non-grating,
                  instructive,
                  true—
                  abusing no one:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Here in the world
                  he takes nothing not-given
                  —long, short,
                  large, small,
                  attractive, not:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  His longing for this
                  & for the next world
                  can’t be found;
                  free from longing, unshackled:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  His attachments,
                  his homes,
                  can’t be found.
                  He, through knowing,8
                  is unperplexed,
                  has reached a footing
                  in          the deathless9:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He has gone
                  beyond attachment here
                  for both merit & evil—
                  sorrowless, dustless, & pure:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Spotless, pure like the moon
                  —limpid & calm—
                  his delights, his becomings,
                  totally gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He has made his way past
                  this hard-going path:
                  delusion, wandering-on.
                  He’s crossed over,
                  has gone beyond,
                  is free from want,
                  from perplexity,
                  absorbed in jhāna,
                  through no-clinging
                  unbound:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Whoever, abandoning sensual passions here,
                  would go forth from home—
                  his sensual passions, becomings,
                  totally gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Whoever, abandoning craving here,
                  would go forth from home—
                  his cravings, becomings,
                  totally gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having left behind
                  the human bond,
                  having made his way past
                  the divine,
                  from all bonds unshackled:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  Having left behind
                  delight & displeasure,
                  cooled, with no acquisitions—
                  a hero who has conquered
                  all the world,
                  every world:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He knows in every way
                  beings’ passing away,
                  and their re-
                  arising;
                  unattached, awakened,
                  well-gone:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He whose course they don’t know

                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He who has nothing
                  —in front, behind, in between—
                  the one with nothing
                  who clings to no thing:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  A splendid bull, conqueror,
                  hero, great seer—
                  free from want,
                  awakened, washed:
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                  He knows          his former lives.
                  He sees          heavens & states of woe,
                  has attained          the ending of birth11:
                
              
              
                
                  He’s what I call
                  a brahman.
                
              
              
                For this is a convention in the world:
                the name & clan determined,
                come into being from common consent,
                here & there determined.
                Taking a position unknowingly
                for a long time obsessively,
                those who don’t know
                say that one is a brahman by birth.
                Not by birth is one a brahman,
                not by birth a non-brahman.
                By action is one a brahman.
                By action one is a non-brahman.
                By action is one a farmer.
                By action one is a craftsman.
                By action is one a merchant.
                By action one is a servant.
                By action is one a thief.
                By action one is a soldier.
                By action is one a sacrificer.
                By action one is a king.
                The wise see action in this way
                as it has come to be,
                seeing          dependent co-arising,
                cognizant          of action’s results.
                Through action the world rolls on.
                People roll on through action.
                In action are beings held bound together,
                as in a linchpin,
                a chariot traveling along.
              
              
                Through austerity, the holy life,
                through restraint & self-control:
                That’s how one is a brahman.
                That’s a brahman
                unexcelled.

                Know, Vāseṭṭha: That’s Brahmā, that’s Sakka,13
                for those who directly know.”
              
            
            When this was said, the young brahmans Vāseṭṭha & Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. We go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.”
            vv. 594–656",(This sutta is identical with MN 98.),"s
              1. In the Brahmanical tradition, this means the three Vedas. Later in this poem, the Buddha will give “three knowledges” a Buddhist definition.
              2. In this context, Vāseṭṭha is referring to action in this lifetime, rather than action in previous lifetimes.
              3. In this and the following verses, the Buddha is playing with three meanings of the word jāti: birth, species, and nature. This point becomes clear when he later contrasts these natural distinctions in the animal world with the conventional distinctions in the human world.
              4. This verse begins a section where the verses are identical with Dhp 396–423, except that the last verse in the series is missing a line present in Dhp 423: “He is a sage who has mastered full-knowing, his mastery totally mastered.”
              This section redefines “brahman” to mean an arahant (although see note 9, below).
              As for “bho-sayer”: Brahmans, when surprised or amazed, tended to use the word bho, or master, as an exclamation. “If he has anything” (reading sa ce with the Burmese and Sri Lankan editions) = if he/she lays claim to anything as his/her own.
              5. The three commentaries explaining this verse—SnA, MA, and DhpA—treat these symbols in slightly different ways. They all agree that the strap = hatred and the thong = craving. As for the remaining symbols, MA simply states that cord = views, bridle = view-obsession, and bar = ignorance.
              SnA and DhpA, however, try to make more of the image by exploring the interconnections of the chariot parts. In their explanation, cord = 62 wrong views (listed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, DN 1) and bridle = obsessions (sensuality, becoming, anger, conceit, views, uncertainty, ignorance (AN 7:11-12)). They note the connection between the 62 wrong views and the obsessions (one of which is views), which is apparently similar to the way the cord and bridle are connected. They go on to note that when one has cut all these things, the bar, which equals ignorance, has been lifted. The fact that the cutting of these chariot parts automatically accomplishes the lifting of the bar is apparently symbolic of the fact that ignorance is one of the obsessions. 
              6. “With no overbearing pride”: reading anussadaṁ with the Thai, Burmese, and Sri Lankan editions. “Last-body”: Because an arahant will not be reborn, this present body is his/her last.
              7. “For himself, on his own, his own ending of stress”: three different ways that the one word attano functions in this verse.
              8. According to SnA, “attachments/homes (ālaya)” = cravings. “Knowing”: the knowledge of full Awakening (aññā).
              9. “A footing in the deathless”: The image here derives from a standard analogy comparing the practice to the act of crossing a river. According to AN 7:15, the point where the meditator gains footing on the river bottom, but before getting up on the bank, corresponds to the third stage of awakening, the attainment of non-return. To reach the fourth stage, becoming an arahant, is to go beyond the river and stand on firm ground. Either this verse is using the image differently, equating the gaining of a footing with arahantship, or else it is the only verse in this set to apply the term “brahman” to a non-returner.
              10. On the fact that even devas and brahmās cannot know the course of the arahant, see MN 49, SN 23:2, AN 11:10, and Dhp 92–93.
              11. The forms of mastery listed in this verse correspond to the three knowledges that comprised the Buddha’s Awakening: knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of how beings pass away and are reborn in the various levels of being, and knowledge of the ending of the effluents that maintain the process of birth (see MN 4). It’s in this verse that the Buddha redefines the three knowledges claimed by Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja, showing that they don’t qualify as masters of the three knowledges that constitute the knowledge of a genuine brahman in his eyes.
              12. Here, of course, the Buddha is referring to the three knowledges as defined by him, not as earlier defined by Vāseṭṭha.
              13. Sakka is the chief of the devas of the heaven of the Thirty-three.",No Additional
Sn 3:10  Kokālika,Sn 3:10,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_10.html,"Sn 3:10  Kokālika  —  A follower of Devadatta slanders Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Moggallāna and, after suffering a painful disease, falls into hell. The sutta then gives a graphic description of the sufferings awaiting him there.","KN/Sn/3:10
          
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the monk Kokālika1 went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, Sāriputta & Moggallāna have evil desires. They have fallen under the sway of evil desires.”
            When this was said, the Blessed One said to him, “Don’t say that, Kokālika. Don’t say that, Kolālika. Make your mind confident in Sāriputta & Moggallāna. They are admirable people.”
            A second time… A third time, the monk Kokālika said to the Blessed One, “Even though the lord Blessed One2 inspires conviction and faith in me, Sāriputta & Moggallāna have evil desires. They have fallen under the sway of evil desires.”
            A third time, the Blessed One said to him, “Don’t say that, Kokālika. Don’t say that, Kolālika. Make your mind confident in Sāriputta & Moggallāna. They are admirable people.”
            Then the monk Kokālika, getting up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, keeping him to his right, and departed.
            Then not long after he had departed, Kokālika’s whole body became covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. From the size of mustard seeds, they became the size of green gram. From the size of green gram, they became the size of black beans. From the size of black beans, they became the size of jujube pits. From the size of jujube pits, they became the size of jujube fruits. From the size of jujube fruits, they became the size of myrobalans. From the size of myrobalans, they became the size of unripe vilva fruits. From the size of unripe vilva fruits, they became the size of small jackfruits. When they were the size of small jackfruits, they burst. Blood and pus flowed out. Then the monk Kokālika died of that disease and, having died, he reappeared in the Paduma hell for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.
            Then Brahmā Sahampati,3 in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, “Lord, the monk Kokālika has died and, having died, has reappeared in the Paduma hell for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.” That is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said that, having bowed down, he circumambulated the Blessed One, keeping him to his right, and disappeared right there.
            Then when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the monks, “Monks, last night Brahmā Sahampati, in the far extreme of the night, his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, came to me. On arrival, having bowed down to me, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to me, ‘Lord, the monk Kokālika has died and, having died, has reappeared in the Paduma hell for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.’ That is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said that, having bowed down, he circumambulated me, keeping me to his right, and disappeared right there.”
            When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, “Lord, how long is the measure of the lifespan in the Paduma hell?”
            “Long, monk, is the measure of the lifespan in the Paduma hell. It’s not easy to calculate ‘this many years’ or ‘this many hundreds of years’ or ‘this many thousands of years’ or ‘this many hundreds of thousands of years.’”
            “But, lord, can a simile be made?”
            “It can, monk,” said the Blessed One. “Suppose that there were a twenty-measure Kosalan cartload of sesame seeds. From that, a man would remove a sesame seed every hundred years.4 That twenty-measure Kosalan cartload of sesame seeds would come to an end in this manner more quickly than a single Abbuda [Swelling] hell. Like twenty Abbuda hells is one Nirabbuda [Free from Swelling] hell. Like twenty Nirabbuda hells is one Ababa [Alas!] hell. Like twenty Ababa hells is one Ahaha hell. Like twenty Ahaha hells is one Aṭaṭa hell. Like twenty Aṭaṭa hells is one Kumuda [White Water Lily] hell. Like twenty Kumuda hells is one Sogandhika [Fragrant White Water Lily] hell. Like twenty Sogandhika hells is one Uppalaka [Blue Lotus] hell. Like twenty Uppalaka hells is one Puṇḍarīka [White Lotus] hell. Like twenty Puṇḍarīka hells is one Paduma [Red Lotus] hell.5
            “The monk Kokālika has reappeared in the Paduma hell, for engendering hatred in his heart against Sāriputta & Moggallāna.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Surely, when a person is born,
              an axe is born in his mouth,
              with which he cuts himself—
              the fool saying a bad statement.
              Whoever praises one deserving censure
              or censures one deserving praise,
              accumulates wickedness6 with his mouth,
              and in that wickedness
              finds no ease.
              Next to nothing is the bad throw
              when one loses money at dice.
              But great is the bad throw
              when one gets angered
              at those well-gone.
              For one hundred thousand Nirabbudas
              and thirty-six and five Abbudas,
              one who maligns noble ones,
              directing his words & heart toward evil,
              goes to hell.7
              
                He goes to hell,
                the one who asserts
                what didn’t take place,
                as does the one
                who, having done,
                says, ‘I didn’t.’
                Both—low-acting people—
                there become equal:
                after death, in the place beyond.8
              
              
                Whoever harasses
                an innocent man,
                a man pure, without blemish:
                The evil comes right back to the fool
                like fine dust
                thrown against the wind.9
              
              
                One devoted to the strings of greed
                slanders others with his words:
                faithless, stingy, miserly, mean,
                devoted to divisive tales.
              
              
                You with your hard road of a mouth,
                untrue, ignoble,
                destroyer          of progress,
                evil, doer          of wrong,
                lowest of men, wicked, degenerate:
                Don’t speak a lot here.
                You are headed to hell.
                You scatter dust
                to your harm.
                You, an offender,
                malign the good,
                and, having engaged
                in many sorts of bad conduct
                are going for a long time
                to the pit.
                For no one’s action is annihilated.
                Surely its owner gets it back.
                An offender, the fool,
                sees suffering for himself
                in the next world.
              
              
                He goes to the place set with iron spikes,
                the sharp-bladed iron stake,
                where the food, as is fitting,
                resembles a ball of heated iron.
                When they [the hell-wardens]
                speak, they don’t speak lovingly.
                They [the hell beings] can’t run away.
                They’re not going to shelter.
                They lie on ashes strewn about.
                They enter a blazing mass of fire.
                Tying them up with nets,
                they [the hell-wardens] strike them
                with hammers made of iron.
                Truly, they go to a blind darkness
                that spreads out like a fog.
                Then they enter a copper pot,
                a blazing mass of fire,
                in which they cook for a long, long time,
                bobbing up & down in a mass of fire.
                There the offender then cooks
                in a mixture of blood & pus.
                In whatever direction he leans to rest
                he festers at the touch.
                There the offender then cooks
                in an ooze where worms live,
                and there is no shore to which he can go,
                for the cooking pots all          around
                are all          the same.
                Then they enter
                the sharp sword-leaf forest
                where their limbs are cut off.
                Seizing them by the tongue with a hook,
                they [the hell-wardens] strike them,
                dragging them back & forth.
                Then they come to the Vettaraṇin,10
                hard to cross,
                with sharp blades, razor blades,
                and there they fall in,
                the fools,
                evil-doers having done
                evil deeds.
                There, while they wail,
                voracious black & spotted dogs,
                jackals, & flocks of ravens chew on them.
                Vultures & crows pick at them.
              
              
                How hard, indeed, is this way of life there
                that offending people come to see.11
                So, for the remainder of life here,
                a person, heedful, should do his duty.
              
              
                Those loads of sesame seeds
                compared to the Paduma hell
                have been calculated by those who know
                as five times ten thousand crores,12
                plus twelve times one hundred more.
              
              
                The length of the hells of suffering
                described here
                is how long [the hell-beings]
                will have to dwell there.
                So when in the company of those
                who are pure, admirable, excellent,
                one should constantly guard
                one’s words & heart.

              1. Kokālika is a bhikkhu, or Buddhist monk. Normally, the texts refer to Buddhist monks as Ven. So-and-so, but in this case, the following story will show why posterity did not accord this honor to Kokālika. According to SnA, this Kokālika was not the same Kokālika who was one of Devadatta’s followers. If that is so, it’s remarkable that both Kokālikas expressed mistrust of Ven. Sāriputta and Moggallāna in exactly the same words (see Cv VII.4.2). An alternative possibility is that the two Kokālikas were actually the same person, and that he participated in Devadatta’s schism during the “not long” period mentioned in this sutta separating his denunciation of Sāriputta and Moggallāna from the onset of his resulting disease.

              5. Perhaps it goes without saying that the names of some of worst hells are ironic. SnA asserts that these are not separate hells, but simply different periods of time in the single Avīci hell, but it gives no explanation or justification for its assertion.

              Asita the seer, in his mid-day meditation,
              saw the Group of Thirty—
              Sakka1 the king, and devas dressed in pure white
              exultant, ecstatic—
              holding up banners, cheering wildly,
              & on seeing the devas so joyful & happy,
              having paid his respects, he said:
              
                “Why is the deva community
                so wildly elated?
                Why are they holding up banners
                & waving them around?
                Even after the war with the Asuras
                —when victory was the devas’,
                the Asuras defeated—
                even then there was nothing hair-raising like this.
                Seeing what marvel
                are the devas so joyful?
                They whistle,
                they sing,
                play music,
                clap their hands,
                dance.
                So I ask you, who live on Mount Meru’s summit.
                Please dispel my doubt quickly, dear sirs.”
              
              
                “The Bodhisatta, the foremost jewel,
                unequaled,
                has been born for welfare & happiness
                in the human world,
                in a town in the Sakyan countryside,
                Lumbini.
                That’s why we’re contented, so wildly elated.
                He, the highest of all beings,
                the ultimate person,
                a bull among men, highest of all people,
                will set turning the Wheel [of Dhamma]
                in the forest named after the seers,
                like a strong, roaring lion,
                the conqueror of beasts.”
              
              
                Hearing these words,
                Asita quickly descended [from heaven]
                and went to Suddhodana’s dwelling.
                There, taking a seat, he said to the Sakyans:
                “Where is the prince?
                I, too, want to see him.”
                The Sakyans then showed
                to the seer named Asita
                their son, the prince,
                like gold aglow,
                burnished by a most skillful smith
                in the mouth of the furnace,
                blazing with glory, flawless in color.
                On seeing the prince blazing like flame,
                pure like the bull of the stars
                going across the sky
                —the burning sun,
                released from the clouds of autumn—
                he was exultant, filled with abundant rapture.
                The devas held in the sky
                a many-spoked sunshade
                of a thousand circles.
                Gold-handled whisks
                waved up & down,
                but those holding the whisks & the sunshade
                couldn’t be seen.
              
              
                The coiled-haired seer
                named Dark Splendor,
                seeing the boy, like an ornament of gold
                on the red woolen blanket,
                a white sunshade held over his head,
                received him, joyful in mind & pleased.
                And on receiving the bull of the Sakyans,
                longingly, the master of mantras & signs
                exclaimed with a confident mind:
                “This one is unsurpassed,
                the highest of the biped race.”
              
              
                Then, foreseeing his own imminent departure,
                he, dejected, shed tears.
                On seeing him weeping,
                the Sakyans asked:
                “But surely there will be
                no danger for the prince?”
                On seeing the Sakyans’ concern
                he replied, “I foresee for the prince
                no harm.
                Nor will there be any danger for him.
                This one’s not insignificant: Be assured.
                This prince will touch
                the ultimate self-awakening.
                He, seeing the utmost purity,
                will set rolling the Wheel of Dhamma
                through sympathy for the welfare of many.
                His holy life will spread far & wide.
              
              
                But as for me,
                my life here has no long remainder.
                My death will take place before then.
                I won’t get to hear
                the Dhamma of this one with the peerless role.
                That’s why I’m stricken,
                afflicted, & pained.”
              
              
                He, having brought the Sakyans
                abundant rapture,
                the follower of the holy life
                left the inner chamber and,
                out of sympathy for his nephew,
                urged him on toward the Dhamma
                of the one with the peerless role:
                “When you hear from another the word,
                ‘Awakened One,’
                or ‘Attaining self-awakening,
                he lays open the path of the Dhamma,’
                go there and, asking him yourself,
                follow the holy life
                under that Blessed One.”
              
              
                Instructed by the one
                whose mind was set on his benefit,
                Such,
                seeing in the future the utmost purity,
                Nālaka, who had laid up a store of merit,
                awaited the Victor expectantly,
                guarding his senses.
                On hearing word of the Victor’s
                turning of the foremost wheel,
                he went, he saw
                the bull among seers. Confident,
                he asked the foremost sage
                about the utmost sagacity,
                now that Asita’s forecast
                had come to pass.
              
              
                Nālaka:
                “Now that I know
                Asita’s words to be true,
                I ask you, Gotama,
                you who have gone
                to the beyond of all dhammas.
                I’m intent on the homeless life;
                I long for the almsround.
                Tell me sage, when asked,
                the highest state of sagacity.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “I’ll teach you
                a sagacity          hard to do,
                hard to master.
                Come now, I’ll tell you.
                Be steadfast. Be firm.
                Practice even-mindedness,
                for in a village
                there’s praise & abuse.
                Ward off any flaw in the heart.
                Go about calmed & not haughty.
                High & low things will come up
                like fire-flames in a forest.
                Women seduce a sage.
                May they not seduce you.2
                Abstaining from sexual intercourse,
                abandoning various sensual pleasures,
                be unopposed, unattached,
                to beings moving & still.
                ‘As I am, so are these.
                As are these, so am I.’
                Drawing the parallel to
                yourself,
                neither kill nor get others to kill.
                Abandoning the wants & greed
                where people run-of-the-mill are stuck,
                practice with vision,
                cross over this hell.
              
              
                Stomach not full,
                moderate in food,
                modest,
                not being greedy,
                always not hungering for wants:
                One without hunger
                is one who’s unbound.
              
              
                Having gone on his almsround, the sage
                should then go to the forest,
                approaching the root of a tree,
                taking a seat.
                The enlightened one, intent on jhāna,
                should find delight in the forest,
                should practice jhāna at the foot of a tree,
                attaining his own satisfaction.
                Then, at the end of the night,
                he should go to the village,
                not delighting in an invitation
                or gift from the village.
                Having gone to the village,
                the sage should not go
                forcing his way among families.
                Cutting off chatter,
                he shouldn’t utter a scheming word.
                ‘I got something,
                that’s fine.
                I got nothing,
                that, too, is good.’
                Being such with regard to both,
                he returns to the very same tree.
                Wandering with his bowl in hand
                —not dumb,
                but seemingly dumb—
                he shouldn’t despise a piddling gift
                nor disparage the giver.
                High & low are the practices
                proclaimed by the contemplative.
                They don’t go twice to the further shore.
                This [unbinding] isn’t sensed only once.3
                In one who has no attachment—
                the monk who has cut the stream,4
                abandoning what is
                & isn’t a duty—
                no fever is found.
              
              
                I’ll teach you
                sagacity:Be like a razor’s edge.
                Pressing tongue against palate,
                restrain your stomach.
                Neither be lazy in mind,
                nor have many thoughts.
                Be free of raw stench,5
                independent,
                having the holy life as your aim.
                Train in     solitude
                & the contemplative’s task,
                Solitude
                is called
                sagacity.
                Alone, you truly delight
                & shine in the ten directions.
              
              
                On hearing the fame of the enlightened
                —those who practice jhāna,
                relinquishing sensuality—
                my disciple should foster
                all the more
                shame & conviction.
              
              
                Know from the rivers
                in clefts & in crevices:
                Those in small channels flow
                noisily,
                the great
                flow silent.
              
              
                Whatever’s deficient
                makes noise.
                Whatever is full
                is quiet.
                The fool is like a half-empty pot;
                one who is wise, a full lake.6
              
              
                A contemplative who speaks a great deal
                endowed with meaning:
                Knowing, he teaches the Dhamma;
                knowing, he speaks a great deal.
                But he who,
                knowing, is restrained,
                knowing, doesn’t speak a great deal:
                He is a sage
                worthy of sagehood.
                He is a sage,
                his sagehood attained.”

              3. According to SnA, the high and low practices taught by the Buddha are, respectively, the practice-mode of pleasant practice and quick intuition, and the practice-mode of painful practice and slow intuition (see AN 4:162). These modes of practice don’t go twice to the further shore in the sense that each of the four paths—to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship—abandons whatever defilements it is capable of abandoning once and for all. There is no need to repeat that particular path. Unbinding is not attained only once in the sense that it is touched as the result of each of the four paths.
              4. SnA: the stream of defilements. However, the stream here could also be the stream of becoming mentioned in Sn 3:12.

Sn 3:12  The Contemplation of Dualities,Sn 3:12,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_12.html,Sn 3:12  The Contemplation of Dualities  —  Not all dualities are misleading. This sutta teaches ways to contemplate the duality of the origination and cessation of stress and suffering so as to reach awakening.,"KN/Sn/3:12
            I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra’s mother. Now on that occasion—the uposatha day of the fifteenth, a perfect full-moon night—the Blessed One was sitting in the open air surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Surveying the silent Saṅgha of monks, he addressed them: “Monks, if there are any who ask, ‘Your listening to teachings that are skillful, noble, leading onward, going to self-awakening is a prerequisite for what?’ they should be told, ‘For the sake of knowing qualities of dualities as they actually are.’ Which duality are you speaking about? ‘This is stress. This is the origination of stress’: This is one contemplation. ‘This is the cessation of stress. This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Those who don’t discern stress,
              what brings stress into play,
              & where it totally stops,
              without trace;
              who don’t know the path,
              the way to the stilling of stress:
              lowly
              in their awareness-release
              & discernment-release,
              incapable
              of making an end,
              they’re headed
              to birth & aging.
              
                But those who discern stress,
                what brings stress into play,
                & where it totally stops,
                without trace;
                who discern the path,
                the way to the stilling of stress:
                consummate
                in their awareness-release
                & discernment-release,
                capable
                of making an end,
                they aren’t headed
                to birth & aging.1
              
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from acquisition2 as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very acquisition, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “From acquisition as cause
              the many forms of stress
              come into being in the world.
              Whoever, unknowing,
              makes acquisitions
              —the dullard—
              comes to stress
              again & again.
              
                Therefore, discerning,
                you shouldn’t create acquisitions
                as you stay focused on
                the birth & origin of stress.”
              
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from ignorance as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very ignorance, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, & resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”
            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “Those who journey the wandering-on
              through birth & death, again & again,
              in this state here
              or anywhere else,
              that destination is simply through ignorance.
              This ignorance is a great delusion
              whereby they have wandered-on
              a long, long time.
              While beings immersed in clear knowing
              don’t go to further becoming.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very fabrication, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation.

              With the cessation of fabrication,
              there is no stress
              coming into play.
              Knowing this drawback—

              with the tranquilizing of all fabrication,
              with the stopping of perception:
              That’s how there is
              the ending of stress.
              Knowing this as it actually is,
              an attainer-of-knowledge

              with the stilling of consciousness, the monk
              free from hunger
              is totally unbound.
            
            “Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from contact as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading & cessation of that very contact, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation.

              following a miserable path,
              the ending of fetters

              While those who comprehend contact,
              delighting in stilling through discernment,
              they, by breaking through contact,
              free from hunger,

              the wandering-          on.
              Knowing this drawback—
              that craving brings stress into play—

              There is death
              for one who is born.
              This is the coming into play
              of stress.
              Thus, with the ending of clinging, the wise
              seeing rightly,

            That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
            
              “All sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
              tactile sensations, & ideas
              that are     welcome,
              appealing,
              agreeable—
              as long as they’re said
              to exist,
              are supposed by the world
              together with its devas
              to be bliss.
              But when they cease,
              that’s supposed by them
              to be stress.
              The stopping of self-identity
              is viewed by the noble ones
              as bliss.
              This, when seen,
              runs counter
              to the whole world.
              
                What others say               is blissful,
                the noble ones say     is stress.
                What others say          is stressful,
                the noble know     as bliss.
                See the Dhamma, hard to understand!
                Here those who don’t know
                are confused.
                For those who are veiled,
                it’s     darkness,
                blindness
                for those who don’t see.
                But for the good it is blatant,
                like light for those who see.
              
              
                Though in its very presence,
                they don’t understand it—
                dumb animals, unadept in the Dhamma.
                It’s not easy
                for those overcome
                by passion for becoming,
                flowing along
                in the stream of becoming,
                falling under Māra’s sway,12
                to wake up
                to this Dhamma.
              
              
                Who, apart from the noble,
                is worthy to wake up
                to this state?—
                the state that,
                through rightly knowing it,
                they totally unbind,
                effluent-free.”
              
            
            That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One’s words. And while this explanation was being given, the minds of 60 monks, through lack of clinging, were released from effluents.

On the psychological level, it denotes anything for which one might have a sense of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ and which, consequently, one would carry around as a kind of mental baggage.

              If one, longing for sensual pleasure,
              achieves it, yes,
              he’s enraptured at heart.

              he’s afflicted,

                Whoever avoids sensual desires
                —as he would, with his foot,

As with all states of becoming, these states are impermanent and stressful.

According to Nd I, “both sides” here has several possible meanings: sensory contact and the origination of sensory contact; past and future; name and form; internal and external sense media; self-identity and the origination of self-identity. It also might mean states of becoming and not-becoming, mentioned in the previous verse and below, in Sn 4:5.

The same three aspects would apply to comprehending perception, as mentioned in the following verse.

              1. Kuppa-paṭicca. Underlying many of the Canon’s explanations of physical and mental phenomena is the theory of dhātu—element or property—in which phenomena are said to happen because an underlying dhātu, which normally exists in a potential form, is provoked into being actualized. Fires, for instance, come from the provocation of the fire dhātu that is everywhere present. When the provocation ends, the dhātu returns to its potential state, and the phenomenon ends. Thus any phenomenon that depends on provocation is by nature inconstant and unreliable. This is one of the reasons why the experience of full release is said to be unprovoked, because it does not depend on the provocation of a dhātu, and so is free from the potential for change. For more on this point, see MN 29, note 3.
              2. Entrenchments: a rendering of the Pali term, nivesana, which can also be translated as dwelling (see Sn 1:12, note 5), abode, situation, home, or establishment.
              Nd II illustrates the meaning of “entrenchments in views” with these ten views (found, in various forms, in DN 9, MN 72, and AN 10:93): “The cosmos is eternal. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.” “The cosmos is not eternal…” “The cosmos is finite…” ”The cosmos is infinite…” ”The soul & the body are the same…” ”The soul is one thing & the body another…” ”After death a Tathāgata exists…” ”After death a Tathāgata does not exist…” ”After death a Tathāgata both does & does not exist…” ”After death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not exist. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless.”

              4. Nd I explains a variety of ways of understanding the word “conceit,” the most comprehensive being a list of nine kinds of conceit: viewing people better than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people on a par with oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people worse than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself. In other words, the truth of the view is not the issue here; the issue is the tendency to compare oneself with others. See AN 6:49. See also AN 4:159.
              5. Nd I: “By what means would he go” to any destination in any state of becoming.
              6. “In connection with what”: a rendering of the instrumental case that attempts to cover several of its meanings, in particular “by what means” and “in terms of what.” For a discussion of the use of the instrumental case in the Aṭṭhaka Vagga, see Sn 4:9, note 4.
              7. This reading follows the Thai, Sri Lankan, and PTS editions: attaṁ nirattaṁ. The Burmese edition reads, attā nirattā: “He has no self, nor what’s opposed to self.” As GD points out in its notes to the translation of this verse, the first reading is probably the correct one, as it relates to the poem’s earlier reference to a person embracing or rejecting a doctrine. The fact that an awakened person is free from both embracing and rejecting is a recurring theme in this vagga and the next; the confusion at present in the various recensions as to whether similar lines should read attaṁ/nirattaṁ or attā/nirattā is a recurring textual theme as well. (See Sn 4:4, note 4; Sn 4:10, note 7; Sn 4:14, note 2.)

              “I see the pure, the supreme,
              free from disease.
              It’s in connection
              with what’s seen
              that a person’s purity
              is.”1
              Understanding thus,
              having known the “supreme,”
              & remaining focused
              on purity,
              one falls back on that knowledge.
              If it’s in connection
              with what is seen
              that a person’s purity is,
              or if stress is abandoned
              in connection with knowledge,
              then a person with acquisitions
              is purified
              in connection with something else,2
              for his view betrays that
              in the way he asserts it.
              
                No brahman3
                says purity
                comes in connection
                with anything else.
                Unsmeared with regard
                to what’s seen, heard, sensed,
                habits or practices,
                merit or evil,
                not creating
                anything here,
                he’s let go
                of what he’d embraced.4
              
              
                Abandoning          what’s first,
                they depend on     what’s next.5
                Following perturbation,6
                they don’t cross over the bond.
                They embrace & reject
                —like a monkey releasing a branch
                to seize at another7—
                a person undertaking practices on his own,
                goes high & low,
                latched onto perception.
                But having clearly known
                through vedas,8 having encountered
                the Dhamma,
                one deeply discerning
                doesn’t go
                high & low.
              
              
                He’s enemy-free9
                with regard to     all things

                By whom, with what,10
                should he
                be pigeonholed
                here in the world?
                —one who has seen in this way,

                They don’t theorize, don’t yearn,
                don’t proclaim “utter purity.”
                Untying the tied-up knot of grasping,
                they don’t form a desire
                anywhere in the world.
              
              
                The brahman

              1. An ancient Indian belief, dating back to the Vedas, was that the sight of certain things or beings was believed to purify. Thus “in connection with what’s seen” here means both that purity is brought about by means of seeing such a sight, and that one’s purity is measured in terms of having such a sight. This belief survives today in the practice of darshan. See DN 16, note 44.
              2. In other words, if purity were simply a matter of seeing or knowing something, a person could be pure in this sense and yet still have acquisitions (= defilements), which would not be true purity. On the use of the phrase, “in connection with,” here, see Sn 4:9, note 4.
              3. “Brahman” in the Buddhist sense, i.e., a person born in any caste who has become an arahant.
              4. Lines such as this may have been the source of the confusion in the different recensions of the Canon—and in Nd I—as to whether the poems in this vagga are concerned with letting go of views that have been embraced (atta) or of self (attā). The compound here, attañjaho, read on its own, could be read either as “he’s let go of what has been embraced” or “he’s let go of self.” However, the following image of a monkey seizing and releasing branches as it moves from tree to tree reinforces the conclusion that the first interpretation is the correct one.
              5. Nd I: Leaving one teacher and going to another; leaving one teaching and going to another. This phrase may also refer to the mind’s tendency to leave one craving to go to another.
              6. For a discussion of unperturbed states of concentration, see MN 106.
              7. “Like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another”—an interesting example of a whole phrase that functions as a lamp, i.e., modifying both the phrase before it and the phrase after it. 
              8. “Vedas”—Just as the word “brahman” is used in a Buddhist sense above, here the word veda is given a Buddhist sense. According to SnA, in this context it means the knowledge accompanying four transcendent paths: the paths to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.
              9. Nd I: The enemies here are the armies of Māra—all unskillful mental qualities. For a detailed inventory of Māra’s armies, see Sn 3:2.
              10. “By whom, with what”—two meanings of the one Pali word, kena.
              11. Nd I: “Open” means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This relates to the many references in Sn to the idea of having one’s roof opened up (see Sn 2:13, note 3). This is in contrast to the image discussed Sn 4:2, note 1.
              12. Nd I: “Territories” = the ten fetters (saṁyojana) and seven obsessions (anusaya).
              13. Nd I: “Passion” = sensuality; “dispassion” = the jhāna states that bring about dispassion for sensuality. However, this may also be a reference to the fact that dispassion is the highest dhamma, whether fabricated or unfabricated (Iti 90), and yet the arahant is described in Sn 5:6 as having transcended all phenomena.

              When dwelling on views
              as “supreme,”
              a person makes them
              the utmost thing in the world,
              &, from that, calls
              all others inferior
              and so he’s not gone beyond disputes.
              When he sees his own advantage
              in what’s seen, heard, sensed,
              or in habits & practices,
              seizing it there
              he sees all else, all others,
              as inferior.
              
                That, too, say the skilled,
                is a binding knot: that
                in dependence on which
                you regard another
                as inferior.
                So a monk shouldn’t be dependent
                on what’s seen, heard, or sensed,
                or on habits & practices;
                nor should he theorize a view in the world
                in connection with knowledge
                or habits & practices;
                shouldn’t take himself
                to be “equal”;
                shouldn’t think himself
                inferior or superlative.
              
              
                Abandoning what he’d embraced,
                not clinging,
                he doesn’t make himself dependent
                even in connection with knowledge;
                doesn’t follow a faction
                among those who are split;
                doesn’t fall back

                here or beyond—

                when considering what’s grasped among doctrines,
                hasn’t the least
                theorized perception
                with regard to what’s seen, heard, or sensed.
                By whom, with what,

              How short this life!
              You die this side of a century,
              but even if you live past,
              you die of old age.
              
                People grieve
                for what they see as mine,
                for          nothing possessed is constant,
                nothing is constantly possessed.1
                Seeing this separation
                simply as it is,
                one shouldn’t follow the household life.
              
              
                At death a person abandons
                what he supposes as mine.
                Realizing this, the wise
                shouldn’t incline
                to be devoted to mine-ness.
              
              
                Just as a man doesn’t see
                on awakening
                what he met in a dream,
                even so he doesn’t see,
                when they are dead
                —their time done—
                those he held dear.
              
              
                When they are seen & heard,
                people are called by this name or that,
                but only the name remains
                to be pointed to
                when they are dead.
              
              
                Grief, lamentation, & selfishness
                are not let go

                so sages
                letting go of possessions,
                go about
                seeing the Secure.

                he who wouldn’t, in any realm,

                The Buddha:
                “In one given over
                to sexual intercourse,
                the teaching is muddled
                and he practices wrongly:
                This is ignoble
                in him.
                Whoever once went alone,
                but then resorts

                lost.
                Seeing this,
                he should train himself
                to abandon sexual intercourse.
              
              
                Overcome by resolves,
                he broods
                like a miserable wretch.
                Hearing the scorn of others,
                he’s chagrined.
                He makes weapons,
                attacked by the words of others.
                This, for him, is a great entanglement.
                He
                sinks

                Knowing these drawbacks, the sage
                here—before & after—
                stays firm in the life alone;
                doesn’t resort to sexual intercourse;

                this, for the noble,
                is highest.

                suppose himself

              —so they say.
              Insisting that what they depend on is good,
              they are deeply entrenched
              in idiosyncratic truths.1
              
                Seeking controversy, they plunge into an assembly,
                regarding one another as fools.
                Relying on others’ authority,
                they speak in debate.
                Desiring praise, they claim to be skilled.
              
              
                Engaged in disputes in the midst of the assembly,
                —anxious, desiring praise—
                the one defeated is
                chagrined.

                He laments, he grieves—the inferior exponent.
                ‘He beat me,’ he mourns.
              
              
                These disputes have arisen among contemplatives.
                In them are
                elation,
                dejection.
                Seeing this, one should abstain from disputes,
                for they have no other goal
                than the gaining of praise.
              
              
                While he who is praised there
                for expounding his doctrine
                in the midst of the assembly,
                laughs on that account & grows haughty,
                attaining his heart’s desire.
              
              
                That haughtiness will be grounds for his damage,
                for he’ll speak in pride & conceit.
                Seeing this, one should abstain from debates.
                No purity is attained by them, say the skilled.
              
              
                Like a strong man nourished on royal food,
                you prowl about, roaring, searching out an opponent.

                go there, strong man.

              1. This information is taken from SnA. The Sanskrit version of this sutta found in the Divyāvadāna provides the same basic information in a narrative much more elaborate than that in SnA. The Sanskrit translation of this sutta found in East Turkestan includes a short prose introduction that agrees in some details with the Divyāvadāna narrative, and in others with the SnA narrative.
              2. Unfortunately, the sutta does not say what Māgandiya’s daughter had done or thought to deserve such a sharp rebuke. See MN 58.
              3. See AN 10:93.
              4. Putting the first two sentences of this verse together and making sense of them is the major challenge for anyone trying to translate this poem. The reading given here is based on considerations of both grammar and context.
              a) First, grammar: The Pali of the first sentence puts the words for “view, learning, knowledge, habit, & practice” in the instrumental case. This case stands for the relationship “by means of” or “because of” but it also has an idiomatic meaning: “in terms of.” (To keep the translation neutral on this point, I have translated with the idiom, “in connection with,” which can carry both possibilities.) The second sentence puts the words for lack of view, etc., in the ablative case, which carries the meaning “because of” or “from.” 
              If we assume that the instrumental case in the first sentence is meant in the sense of “by means of,” then we are dealing—as Māgandiya asserts—with plain nonsense: The first sentence would say that a person cannot achieve purity by means of views, etc., while the second sentence would be saying that he cannot achieve purity by means of no view, etc. 
              The fact that the two sentences place the relevant terms in different grammatical cases, though, suggests that they are talking about two different kinds of relationships. If we take the instrumental in the first sentence idiomatically in the sense of “in terms of,” then the verse not only makes sense but also fits in with teachings of the rest of the Pali suttas: A person cannot be said to be pure simply because he/she holds to a particular view, body of learning, etc. Purity is not defined in those terms. The second sentence goes on to say that a person doesn’t arrive at purity from a lack of view, etc. Putting the two sentences together with the third, the message is this: One uses right views, learning, knowledge, habits, & practices as a path, a means for arriving at purity. Once one arrives, one lets go of the path, because the purity of inner peace, in its ultimate sense, is something transcending the means by which it is reached.
              b) The immediate context of this verse supports this interpretation. The Buddha’s initial statement here is an answer, not to the question of how the goal is attained, but to Māgandiya’s question of how an enlightened person would describe the goal. The Buddha responds by contradicting the general views current in his time as to how such a state would be defined, and so in this context the meaning of “in terms of” makes the most immediate sense. Then, having shown that description isn’t helpful, the Buddha goes on to discuss the most useful thing that can be said about such a state: how to get there. 
              However, in the verse immediately following this one, it’s obvious that Māgandiya has not caught this distinction and so misses the Buddha’s point.
              For further illustrations of the role of right view in taking one to a dimension beyond all views, see AN 10:93, AN 10:96, MN 22 (in particular, the simile of the raft), and MN 24. (The analogy of the relay coaches in MN 24 actually seems more tailored to the issues raised by the Buddha’s remarks in this sutta than it does to the question it addresses in that one.)","sections III/H and III/H/i in The Wings to Awakening. 
              Nd I, without explaining the grammatical word play at work in this verse, offers an interpretation in line with the one offered in this note: On the one hand, it says, one doesn’t describe purity or release in terms of view, etc. On the other, one cannot attain inner peace without using a measure of right view, learning, knowledge, habit (virtue), and practice. It defines right view in terms of mundane right view, described in MN 117; learning in terms of the voice of another (AN 2:124) and the nine traditional divisions of Dhamma in the Canon: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions (AN 7:64); knowledge in terms of knowledge of what has been done by action, knowledge in line with the four noble truths, the knowledge of the six forms of direct knowing (AN 5:28), and knowledge of the nine concentration attainments (AN 9:33); habit (virtue) in terms of restraint in the Pāṭimokkha (AN 10:17); and practice in terms of eight of the dhutaṅga practices: living in the wilderness, going for alms, wearing cast-off cloth, wearing only one triple set of robes, bypassing no donors on one’s alms round, refusing food brought afterwards, not lying down, and accepting whatever lodging one is assigned (see Thag 16:7 and SN 16:5). It is important to note that Nd I does not insist that all these practices and forms of knowledge, etc., must be completely mastered to attain inner peace. Instead, it insists that a “measure” (matta) be mastered, without defining how large that measure must be. 
              5. The lines of this verse up to this point are clearly missing in the text of the Sanskrit version found in East Turkestan. Hoernle, the scholar who first studied the text, concluded that the lines in the Pali here must have been a later interpolation, but it’s also possible that the Sanskrit was either a faulty translation or an accurate translation based on a faulty transmission of the text.
              6. “In terms of—by means of”: Two ways of interpreting the instrumental case in this sentence.
              7. A long explanation of this verse, attributed to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, is contained in SN 22:3. The main points are these:
              “The property of form, householder, is the home of consciousness. When consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of form, it is said to be living at home. The property of feeling… perception… fabrication is the home of consciousness. When consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of fabrication, it is said to be dwelling at home.
              “And how does one not live at home? Any desire, passion, delight, craving, any attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions with regard to the property of form: These the Tathāgata has abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Therefore the Tathāgata is said to be not dwelling at home.
              [Similarly with the remaining aggregates.] …
              “And how does one live free from society? The Tathāgata has abandoned bondage to the distraction of the society of form-impressions, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising. Therefore the Tathāgata is said to be living free from society.
              [Similarly with the society of sound-impressions, aroma-impressions, flavor-impressions, tactile-sensation-impressions, and idea-impressions.]
              “And how is one not intimate in villages? There is the case where a monk lives unentangled with householders. Not delighting together with them, not sorrowing together with them, not happy when they are happy, not pained when they are pained, he does not take on any of their arisen business affairs as his own duty. This is how one is not intimate in villages.…
              “And how is one remote from sensuality? There is the case where a certain person is free of passion for sensuality, free of desire, free of love, free of thirst, free of fever, free of craving for sensuality. This is how one is remote from sensuality.…
              “And how is one free from preferences? There is the case where a certain person does not think, ‘May form be like this in the future. May feeling.… May perception.… May fabrication.… May consciousness be like this in the future.’ This is how one is free from preferences.…
              “And how does one not engage with people in quarrelsome debate? There is the case where a certain person is not a fomenter of this kind of debate: ‘You understand this doctrine & discipline? I’m the one who understands this doctrine & discipline. How could you understand this doctrine & discipline? You’re practicing wrongly. I’m practicing rightly. What should be said first you said last. What should be said last you said first. I’m being consistent. You’re not. What you took so long to think out has been refuted. Your doctrine has been overthrown. You’re defeated. Go and try to salvage your doctrine, or extricate yourself if you can!’ This is how one does not engage with people in quarrelsome debate.”
              8. “Measured … made proud”—two meanings of the Pali word mānameti.
              9. To be fashioned by something is to define oneself around it. See MN 78, note 2; and MN 113. For discussions of the role of non-fashioning in the practice, see The Wings to Awakening, II/B and III/G, and The Paradox of Becoming, chapter 6. 
              10. “Action” here can mean either kamma in a restricted sense, as ritual action, or in its general sense, meaning that the attainer-of-knowledge has gone beyond creating seeds of kamma that will lead to further becoming (see AN 3:34). According to Nd I, “action” here denotes the three types of fabrication (abhisaṅkhāra): meritorious (ripening in pleasure), demeritorious (ripening in pain), and imperturbable (the formless attainments)—see DN 33.

                Not drunk on enticements,

                Not in hopes of material gain

                he isn’t upset.

              1. Nd I: “Independent of before & the end” = no craving or view with regard to past or future.
              2. For discussions of how the awakened one cannot be classified even in the present, see MN 72 and SN 22:85–86.
              3. Nd I: “He sees seclusion in the midst of sensory contacts” = he sees contact as empty of self. This passage may also refer to the fact that the awakened person experiences sensory contact as if disjoined from it. On this point, see MN 140 and MN 146, quoted in The Mind Like Fire Unbound, chapter 4.
              4. See AN 10:93.
              5. Beyond conviction & dispassion—The Pali here can also mean, “A person of no conviction, he does not put away passion.” This is an example of the kind of pun occasionally used in Pali poetry for its shock value. Other examples are at Dhp 97 and the end of Sn 4:13. For examples of what is meant by being beyond conviction, see SN 12:68 and SN 48:44. For an explanation of what is meant by being beyond dispassion, see Sn 4:6, note 2. An alternate explanation is that, as Sn 5:6 indicates, the arahant is beyond all dhammas, dispassion included.
              6. The Pali word taṇhāya—by/through craving—functions here as a lamp.
              7. This reading follows the Thai and PTS editions: attaṁ vā-pi nirattaṁ vā. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions read, attā vā-pi nirattā vā: “self or what’s opposed to self.” The first reading seems preferable for two reasons: First, it follows the theme established in Sn 4:3 and Sn 4:4 (and also followed in Sn 4:15 and Sn 5:11) that the awakened person has gone beyond embracing or rejecting views. Second, the word nirattā is found nowhere else in the Canon aside from the two other verses in Sn (4:3 and 4:14) where it is offered as a possible alternative reading for niratta (released, rejected). As niratta is clearly the preferable alternative in Sn 4:3, I have adopted it here and in Sn 4:14 as well.

              1. As other passages in this poem indicate (see note 6, below), the goal is not measured in terms of knowledge, but as this passage points out, knowledge is a necessary part of the path to the goal.
              2. According to Nd I, “percipient of perceptions” means having ordinary perceptions. “Percipient of aberrant perceptions” means being insane. “Unpercipient” means either having entered the cessation of perception and feeling (see AN 9:33) or the dimension of beings without perception (DN 1 and DN 15). “Percipient of what’s disappeared” (or: having perceptions that have disappeared) means having entered any of the four formless states. Of these four explanations, the last is the least likely, for as the next lines show, this passage is describing the stage of concentration practice in which one is transcending the fourth jhāna and entering the formless attainment of the infinitude of space. A more likely explanation of “percipient of what’s disappeared” would be the act of holding to perceptions of the breath and of pleasure and pain, even though these phenomena have all disappeared in the fourth jhāna (see SN 36:11, AN 9:31, AN 10:20, and AN 10:72).
              3. This is the point where the meditator leaves the fourth jhāna and enters the perception of the infinitude of space.
              4. Objectification-classifications (papañca-saṅkhā): Nd I defines papañca simply as craving, views, and conceit. A survey of how the term papañca is actually used in the suttas, however, shows that it denotes the mind’s tendency to objectify itself as a being. Then, from that objectification, it searches for nourishment to keep that being in existence, classifying experience in terms conducive to that search and thus giving rise to conflict. As Sn 4:14 points out, the root of the objectification-classifications is the perception, “I am the thinker.” For further discussion of this point, see note 1 to that sutta and the introduction to MN 18.
              5. “Spirit” is the usual rendering of the Pali word, yakkha. According to Nd I, however, in this context the word yakkha means person, individual, human being, or living being.
              6. In other words, the sage knows that both groups in the previous verse fall back on their knowledge as a measure of the goal, without comprehending the dependency still latent in their knowledge. The sages in the first group are mistaking the experience of neither perception nor non-perception as the goal, and so they are still dependent on that state of concentration. The sages in the second group, by the fact that they claim to be skilled, show that there is still a latent conceit in their experience of not-clinging, and thus it is not totally independent of clinging. (For more on this point, see MN 102.) Both groups still maintain the concept of a “spirit” that is purified in the realization of purity. Once these dependencies are comprehended, one gains release from disputes and from states of becoming and not-becoming. It is in this way that knowledge is a means to the goal, but the goal itself is not measured or defined in terms of knowledge.",: DN 21; Ud 2:4

              “Dwelling on
              their own views,
              quarreling,
              different skilled people say:
              ‘Whoever knows this, understands Dhamma.
              Whoever rejects this, is
              imperfect.’
              Thus quarreling, they dispute:
              ‘My opponent’s a fool & unskilled.’
              Which of these statements is true
              when all of them say they are skilled?”
              
                “If, in not accepting
                an opponent’s doctrine,
                one’s a fool, a beast of inferior discernment,
                then all are fools of inferior discernment—
                all of these
                who dwell on their views.
                But if, in siding with a view,
                one’s cleansed,
                with discernment made pure,
                sensible, skilled,
                then none of them
                are of inferior discernment,
                for all of them
                have their own views.
              
              
                I don’t say, ‘That’s how it is,’
                the way fools tell one another.
                They each make out their views to be true
                and so regard their opponents as fools.”
              
              
                “What some say is true
                —’That’s how it is’—
                others say is ‘falsehood, a lie.’
                Thus quarreling, they dispute.
                Why can’t contemplatives
                say one thing & the same?”
              
              
                “The truth is one,1
                there is no second
                about which a person who knows it
                would argue with one who knows.
                Contemplatives promote
                their various own truths,
                that’s why they don’t say
                one thing & the same.”
              
              
                “But why do they say
                various truths,
                those who say they are skilled?
                Have they learned many various truths
                or do they follow conjecture?”
              
              
                “Apart from their perception
                there are no
                many
                various
                constant truths
                in the world.2
                Theorizing conjectures
                with regard to views,
                they speak of a pair: true
                & false.
                Dependent on what’s seen,
                heard,
                & sensed,
                dependent on habits & practices,
                one shows disdain [for others].
                Taking a stance on his decisions,
                praising himself, he says,
                ‘My opponent’s a fool & unskilled.’
                That by which
                he regards his opponents as fools
                is that by which
                he says he is skilled.
                Calling himself skilled,
                he despises another
                who speaks the same way.
              
              
                Agreeing on a view gone out of bounds,
                drunk with conceit, imagining himself perfect,
                he has consecrated, with his own mind,
                himself
                as well as his view.
              
              
                If, by an opponent’s word,
                one’s inferior,
                the opponent’s
                of inferior discernment as well.
                But if, by one’s own word
                one’s an attainer-of-knowledge, enlightened,
                no one
                among contemplatives
                is a fool.
              
              
                ‘Those who approve of a doctrine other than this
                are lacking in purity,
                imperfect.’
                That’s what the many sectarians say,
                for they’re smitten with passion
                for their own views.
                ‘Only here is there purity,’
                that’s what they say.
                ‘In no other doctrine
                is purity,’ they say.
                That’s how the many sectarians
                are entrenched,
                speaking firmly there
                concerning their own path.
                Speaking firmly concerning your own path,
                what opponent here would you take as a fool?
                You’d simply bring strife on yourself
                if you said your opponent’s a fool
                with an impure doctrine.
              
              
                Taking     a stance on your decisions,
                & yourself as your measure,
                you dispute further down
                into the world.
              
              
                But a person who’s abandoned
                all decisions
                creates no strife
                in the world.”

              1. “The truth is one”: This statement should be kept in mind throughout the following verses, as it forms the background to the discussion of how people who theorize their conjectures speak of the pair, true and false. The Buddha is not denying that there is such a thing as true and false, or that some statements correspond more truly to reality than others. He avoids defending his own teachings in debates, not because there are many different truths, but because—as he says in Sn 4:8, the purpose of debates is not to arrive at truth but to gain praise. In this way, it encourages the debater to get entrenched in his views. All entrenched views, regardless of how true or false their content might be, behave in line with the truth of conditioned phenomena as explained in the preceding sutta. They lead to conceit, conflict, and states of becoming. When they are viewed in this way—as events in a causal chain rather than as true or false depictions of other events (or as events rather than signs)—the tendency to hold to or become entrenched in them is diminished. This allows for a practitioner to hold to the truths of right view for the sake of putting an end to suffering and stress, and then to put aside any attachment to those truths once they have performed their duty. On this point, see MN 22 and AN 10:93, and the essay, “Truths with Consequences.”

              “Those who, dwelling on views,
              dispute, saying, ‘Only this is true’:
              Do they all incur blame,
              or also earn praise there?”
              
                “[The praise:] It’s such a small thing,
                not at all appeasing.1
                I speak of two fruits of dispute;
                and seeing this, you shouldn’t dispute—
                seeing the state
                where there’s no dispute
                as secure.
              
              
                One who knows
                doesn’t enter into
                any conventions
                born of the run-of-the mill
                at all.
                One who’s uninvolved:
                When he’s forming no predilection
                for what’s seen, for what’s heard,
                why would he get
                involved?2
              
              
                Those for whom habits 
                are ultimate
                say that purity’s
                a matter of self-restraint.
                Undertaking a practice,
                they devote themselves to it:
                ‘Let’s train just in this,
                and then there would be purity.’
                Those who say they are skilled
                are [thus] led on to becoming.
                But if one of them falls
                from his habits or practice,
                he trembles,
                having failed in his actions.
                He hopes for, longs for, purity,
                like a caravan leader     lost
                far from home.
              
              
                But one who’s abandoned
                habits & practices3
                —all—
                things that are blamable, blameless,4
                not hoping for ‘pure’ or ‘impure,’5
                would live in kindness & peace,
                without taking up peace,6
                detached.
              
              
                Dependent
                on taboos, austerities,
                or what’s seen, heard, or sensed,
                they speak of purity
                through wandering further on
                through becoming & not-,
                their craving not gone
                for becoming & not-.7
                For one who aspires has longings
                & trembling with regard to theorizings.
                But one who here
                has no passing away & arising:
                Why would he tremble?
                For what would he long?”
              
              
                “The teaching some say is ‘supreme,’
                is the very one others call ‘lowly.’
                Which statement is true
                when all of these claim to be skilled?”
              
              
                “They say their own teaching is perfect
                while the doctrine of others is lowly.
                Thus quarreling, they dispute,
                each saying his agreed-on opinion
                is true.
                If something, because of an opponent’s say-so,
                were lowly,
                then none among teachings would be
                superlative,
                for many say
                that another’s teaching’s inferior
                when firmly asserting their own.
                If their worship of their teaching were true,
                in line with the way they praise their own path,
                then all doctrines
                would be true—
                for purity’s theirs, according to each.
              
              
                The brahman has nothing
                led by another,
                when considering what’s grasped
                among doctrines.
                Thus he has gone
                beyond disputes,
                for he doesn’t regard as best
                the knowledge of a doctrine,
                any other doctrine.8
              
              
                ‘I know. I see. That’s just how it is!’—
                Some believe purity’s in terms of view.
                But even if a person has seen,
                what good does it do him?
                Having slipped past,
                they speak of purity
                in connection with something
                or somebody     else.
                A person, in seeing,
                sees name-&-form.
                Having seen, he’ll know
                only these things.
                No matter if he’s seen little, a lot,
                the skilled don’t say purity’s
                in connection with that.
              
              
                A person entrenched in his teachings,
                preferring a theorized view,
                isn’t easy to discipline.
                Whatever he depends on
                he describes it as lovely,
                says     that it’s purity,
                that there he saw truth.
              
              
                The brahman, evaluating,
                doesn’t enter into a theory,
                doesn’t follow views,
                isn’t tied even to knowledge.9
                And on knowing
                whatever’s conventional, commonplace,
                he remains equanimous:
                ‘That’s what others hold onto.’
              
              
                Having untied the knots
                here in the world,
                the sage here in the world10
                doesn’t follow a faction
                when disputes have arisen.
                At peace among those not at peace,
                he’s equanimous, doesn’t hold on:
                ‘That’s what others hold onto.’
              
              
                Giving up old effluents,
                not forming new,
                neither pursuing desire,
                nor entrenched in his teachings,
                he’s totally released
                from viewpoints,
                enlightened.
              
              
                He doesn’t adhere to the world,
                is without self-rebuke;
                is enemy-free11
                with regard to all things
                seen, heard, or sensed.
              
              
                His burden laid down,

                is improper :: is theory-free
                hasn’t stopped :: isn’t impassioned

              1. Or: Not enough to appease (the defilements, says Nd I).
              2. A Sanskrit version of this verse is quoted by Asaṅga in the Bodhisattvabhūmi (48.24).
              3. Nd I: Abandoning habits & practices in the sense of no longer believing that purity is measured in terms of them, the view discussed in the preceding verse. See MN 79.
              4. Nd I: “Blamable, blameless” = black and white kamma (see AN 4:232, 234, 237–238, quoted in The Wings to Awakening, section I/B.
              5. Nd I: Having abandoned impure mental qualities, and having fully attained the goal, the arahant has no need to hope for anything at all. 
              6. “In kindness & peace, without taking up peace”—a pun on the word, santimanuggahaya.
              7. The word bhavabhavesu—”through/for becoming & not-becoming”—functions here as a lamp.
              8. “The knowledge of a doctrine, any other doctrine”—a pun on the word, dhammamaññam. Nd I favors the second interpretation, saying that the brahman does not see as best any doctrine aside from the Wings to Awakening: the establishings of mindfulness, the exertions, the bases of power, the faculties, the strengths, the factors for awakening, and the noble eightfold path. This reading seems unlikely, though, as these doctrines are not mentioned anywhere in this poem. The first reading is more in line with the Buddha’s statement in Sn 4:9 that the highest state is not defined in terms of knowledge, and is well-illustrated in action in AN 10:93.
              9. According to Nd I, this compound—ñāṇa-bandhu—should be translated as “tied by means of knowledge,” in that the arahant doesn’t use the knowledge that comes with the mastery of concentration, the five mundane forms of psychic power (abhiñña), or any wrong knowledge to create the bonds of craving or views. However, the compound may also refer to the fact that the arahant isn’t tied even to the knowledge that forms part of the path to arahantship (see MN 117).

                He should train, always mindful,
                to subdue any craving inside him.
                Whatever truth he may know,
                within or without,
                he shouldn’t, because of it,
                make himself hardened,

                He shouldn’t, because of it, think himself
                better,
                lower, or
                equal.
                Touched by contact in various ways,
                he shouldn’t keep theorizing about self.
                Stilled right within,
                a monk shouldn’t seek peace from another,
                from anything else.
                For one stilled right within,

                As in the middle of the sea
                it is still,
                with no waves upwelling,
                so the monk—unperturbed, still—
                should not swell himself

                as mine.
                When touched by contact,
                he shouldn’t lament,
                shouldn’t covet anywhere any
                states of becoming,
                or tremble at terrors.
                When gaining food & drink,
                staples & cloth,
                he should not make a hoard.
                Nor should he be upset
                when receiving no gains.
                Doing jhāna,           not footloose,

                Not making much of sleep,
                ardent, given to wakefulness,
                he should abandon weariness, deception,
                laughter, sports,
                sexual intercourse,
                & all that goes with it;

                should not be devoted to

                A monk shouldn’t tremble at blame
                or grow haughty with praise;
                should dispel stinginess, greed,

                A monk shouldn’t boast
                or speak with ulterior motive,
                shouldn’t train in insolence
                or speak quarrelsome words;
                shouldn’t engage in lies
                or knowingly cheat;
                shouldn’t despise others for their

                habits,

                Annoyed on hearing many words
                from contemplatives
                or ordinary people,
                he shouldn’t respond harshly,
                for those who retaliate
                aren’t calm.
              
              
                Knowing this teaching,
                a monk inquiring
                should always
                train in it mindfully.
                Knowing unbinding as peace,
                he shouldn’t be heedless
                of Gotama’s message—
                for he, the Conqueror unconquered,
                witnessed the Dhamma,
                not by hearsay,
                but directly, himself.
                So, heedful, you
                should always do homage & train
                in line with that Blessed One’s message,”
              
              
                the Blessed One said.4

              1. On objectification-classifications and their role in leading to conflict, see Sn 4:11 and the introduction to MN 18. The perception, “I am the thinker” lies at the root of these classifications in that it identifies oneself as a being. Because a being requires food, both physical and mental (see SN 12:63–64 and Khp 4), this creates conflict with others seeking food. Because an identity as a being also involves attachment (see SN 23:2), this perception involves internal conflict as well, as whatever one identifies with will inevitably change. The conceit inherent in this perception thus forms a fetter on the mind. To become unbound, one must learn to examine this perception—to see that it is simply an assumption that is not inherent in experience, and that we would be better off learning how to drop it.
              2. This reading follows the version of the verse given in the Thai edition of Nd I, as well as an alternative reading given as a footnote to the Sri Lankan edition of Sn 4:14: n’atthi attaṁ kuto nirattaṁ vā. The Burmese and Sri Lankan editions of this verse read, n’atthi attā kuto nirattā vā: “There is no self, so how what’s opposed to self?” The Thai edition of Sn 4:14 reads, n’atthi attā kuto nirattaṁ vā: “There is no self, so how what’s rejected?” This last reading makes no sense; the Burmese and Sri Lankan readings depend on the notion that nirattā is an actual word, although it appears nowhere in the Canon except in two other verses of the Aṭṭhaka Vagga, where it is cited as a possible alternative to niratta (Sn 4:3 and Sn 4:10). Because the Buddha in SN 44:10 refuses to take the position that there is no self, and because he says in MN 2 that the questions, “Do I exist? Do I not exist?” are unworthy of attention, all of the readings of this verse that say n’atthi attā would appear to be wrong. Thus I have adopted the reading given here. 
              3. Āthabbaṇa. Some scholars have identified this term with the Atharvaveda, but the identification is uncertain. It could also be a generic term for casting spells and curses of any sort. Nd I interprets this term simply as referring to spells for bringing about calamities and diseases for one’s enemies.

              “When embraced,
              the rod of violence1
              breeds danger & fear:
              Look at people in strife.
              I will tell how
              I experienced
              terror:
              Seeing people floundering
              like fish in small puddles,
              competing with one another—
              as I saw this,
              fear came into me.
              The world was entirely
              without substance.
              All the directions
              were knocked out of line.
              Wanting a haven for myself,
              I saw nothing that wasn’t laid claim to.
              Seeing nothing in the end
              but competition,
              I felt discontent.
              And then I saw
              an arrow here,
              so very hard to see,
              embedded in the heart.
              Overcome by this arrow
              you run in all directions.
              But simply on pulling it out
              you don’t run,
              you don’t sink.2
              
                [Here the trainings are recited.] 3
              
              
                Whatever things are tied down in the world,
                you shouldn’t be set on them.
                Having totally penetrated
                sensual pleasures,
                sensual passions,4
                you should train for your own
                unbinding.
              
              
                Be truthful, not insolent,
                not deceptive, remote
                from divisiveness.
                Without anger, the sage
                should cross over the evil
                of greed & avarice.
                He should conquer drowsiness,
                weariness,
                sloth;
                shouldn’t consort with heedlessness,
                shouldn’t stand firm in his pride—
                the man with his heart set
                on unbinding.
              
              
                He shouldn’t engage in lying,
                shouldn’t create affection for form,
                should fully fathom conceit,
                and live refraining from impulsiveness;
                shouldn’t          delight in what’s old,
                prefer what’s new,5
                grieve over decline,
                get entangled in
                what’s dazzling & bright.6
              
              
                I call greed
                a great flood;
                hunger, a swift current.
                Preoccupations are ripples;
                sensuality, a bog
                hard to cross over.
                Not deviating from truth,
                a sage stands on high ground
                : a brahman.7
              
              
                Having relinquished
                in every way,
                he is said to be
                at peace;
                having clearly known, he
                is an attainer-of-knowledge;
                knowing the Dhamma, he’s
                independent.
                Moving rightly through the world,
                he doesn’t envy
                anyone here.
              
              
                Whoever here has gone beyond
                sensual passions—
                an attachment hard
                to transcend in the world—
                doesn’t sorrow,
                doesn’t fret.
                He, his stream8 cut, is free
                from bonds.
              
              
                Burn up what’s before,
                and have nothing for after.
                If you don’t grasp
                at what’s in between,9
                you will go about, calm.
              
              
                For whom, in name-&-form,
                in every way,
                there’s no sense of mine,
                and who doesn’t grieve
                over what is not:
                He, in the world,
                isn’t defeated,
                suffers no loss.10
              
              
                To whom there doesn’t occur
                ‘This is mine,’
                for whom nothing is others’:
                He, feeling no sense of mine-ness,
                doesn’t grieve at the thought
                ‘I have nothing.’
              
              
                Not harsh,
                not greedy,

                from theorizing.
              
              
                For one unperturbed
                —who knows—
                there’s no accumulating.
                Abstaining, unaroused,

                security.13
                The sage
                doesn’t speak of himself
                as among those who are higher,
                equal,
                or lower.
                At peace, free of stinginess,

              have I seen or heard
              from anyone
              of a teacher with such lovely speech
              come, together with his following
              from Tusita heaven,1
              as the One with Eyes
              who appears to the world with its devas,
              having dispelled all darkness,
              having arrived at delight
              all alone.
              
                To that One Awakened—
                unentangled, Such, un-
                deceptive,
                come with his following—
                I have come desiring a question
                on behalf of the many
                here who are fettered:
                For a monk disaffected,
                frequenting a place remote—
                the root of a tree,
                a cemetery,
                in mountain caves
                various places to stay—
                how many are the fears there
                at which he shouldn’t tremble
                —there in his noiseless abode—
                how many the dangers in the world
                for the monk          going the direction
                he never has gone
                over which he should prevail
                there in his isolated abode?
                What should be
                the ways of his speech?
                What should be
                his range there of action?
                What should be
                a resolute monk’s
                habits & practices?2
                Undertaking what training
                — mindful, astute, alone —
                would he blow away
                his own impurities
                as a silver smith,
                those in molten silver?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “I will tell you
                as one who knows,
                what is comfort
                for one disaffected
                if he’s resorting to a place remote,
                desiring self-awakening
                in line with the Dhamma.
                An enlightened monk,
                living circumscribed,
                mindful,
                shouldn’t fear the five fears:
                of horseflies, mosquitoes, snakes,
                human contact, four-footed beings;
                shouldn’t be fazed
                by those following another’s teaching
                even on seeing their manifold
                threats;
                should prevail over still other
                further dangers
                as he seeks what is skillful.
              
              
                Touched
                by the touch
                of disease, hunger,
                he should endure cold
                & inordinate heat.
                He with no home,
                in many ways touched by these things,
                striving, should make firm his persistence.
              
              
                He shouldn’t commit a theft,
                shouldn’t speak a lie,
                should touch with thoughts of goodwill
                beings firm & infirm.
                Conscious of when
                his mind is stirred up & turbid,
                he should dispel it:
                ‘It’s on the side
                of the Dark One.’
              
              
                He shouldn’t come under the sway
                of anger or pride.
                Having dug up their root
                he would stand firm.
                Then, when prevailing
                —yes—
                he’d prevail over notions of dear & undear.
              
              
                Deferring          to discernment
                enraptured          with what’s admirable,
                he should overcome these dangers,
                should conquer
                discontent
                in his isolated spot,
                should conquer
                these four
                thoughts of lament:
              
              
                ‘What will I eat,
                or where will I eat?
                How badly I slept.
                Tonight where will I sleep?’
              
              
                These lamenting thoughts
                he should subdue—
                one under training,
                wandering without home.
                Receiving food & cloth
                at appropriate times,
                he should have a sense of enough
                for the sake of contentment.3
                Guarded in regard to these things
                going restrained into a village,
                even when harassed
                he shouldn’t say a harsh word.
              
              
                With eyes downcast,
                & not footloose,
                committed to jhāna,
                he should be continually wakeful.4
                Arousing equanimity,
                centered within,
                he should cut off any penchant
                to conjecture or worry.
                When reprimanded with words,
                he should—mindful—
                rejoice;5
                should smash any rigidity
                toward his fellows in the holy life;
                should utter skillful words
                that are not untimely;
                should give no mind
                to the gossip people might say.
              
              
                And then there are in the world
                the five kinds of dust
                for whose subduing, mindful,
                he should train:
                With regard to forms, sounds, tastes,
                smells, & tactile sensations
                he should conquer passion;
                with regard to these things
                he should subdue his desire.
              
              
                A monk, mindful,
                his mind well released,
                contemplating the right Dhamma
                at the right times,
                on coming
                to oneness6
                should annihilate
                darkness,”
              
              
                the Blessed One said.

            Prologue
            
              From the delightful city of the Kosalans,
              a brahman [Bāvarī]
              who had mastered mantras,
              aspiring to nothingness,1
              went to the Southern country.
              He, in the land of Assaka,
              the neighborhood of Muḷaka,
              on the bank of the Godhāvarī,
              lived on gleanings & fruits.
              Close by was a large village.
              And with the income from that village
              he performed a great sacrifice.
              Having sacrificed the great sacrifice,
              he returned again to his ashram.
              
                As soon as he had entered there,
                another brahman came along:
                thirsty, with
                scratched feet,
                dirty teeth,
                dusty head.
                On arrival, he asked Bāvarī
                for five hundred [pieces of money].
                Bāvarī, on seeing him, invited him to sit down,
                asked after what is pleasant & skillful,
                and said these words:
                “Whatever of mine
                that could be given away,
                I have disposed of entirely.
                Forgive me, brahman,
                I don’t have five hundred.”
              
              
                “If you don’t hand over
                to me when I ask,
                within seven days,
                may your head split
                into seven pieces.”
              
              
                Dissembling, the imposter
                proclaimed threats.
                Hearing his words,
                Bāvarī was distressed.
                He wasted away, taking no food,
                afflicted with the arrow of grief,
                and, with his mind this way,
                his heart found no delight in jhāna.
              
              
                Seeing him nervous & distressed,
                a devatā wishing his welfare,
                approached Bāvarī
                and said these words:
                “That imposter, wanting money,
                doesn’t discern heads;
                has no knowledge of heads
                or the splitting of heads.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “You, sir, surely know.
                Explain to me when asked:
                heads & the splitting of heads.
                I will listen to your words.”
              
              
                The devatā:
                “I too don’t know that.
                I don’t have that knowledge.
                Heads & the splitting of heads:
                That is surely the insight of Victors.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “Then who knows surely
                in this circle of the earth,
                heads & the splitting of heads?
                Explain that to me, devatā.”
              
              
                The devatā:
                “Gone forth from the city of Kapilavatthu,
                the chief of the world,
                a descendant of King Okkāka,
                a Sakyan-son, a bringer of light:
                He, brahman, is Rightly Self-Awakened,
                gone to the far shore of all
                dhammas;
                attainer of all
                direct knowledges & strengths,
                one with an Eye that sees all
                dhammas;
                attainer of the end of all
                action,
                released in the ending of acquisitions.
                He, the One with Eyes,
                awakened, blessed,
                teaches the Dhamma.
                Going to him, you ask him.
                He will answer you.”
              
              
                Hearing the word “Self-Awakened,”
                Bāvarī was exultant.
                His grief subsided,
                and he gained abundant rapture.
                So Bāvarī, gratified, exultant,
                excited, asked the devatā:
                “In which village or town,
                or in which country
                is the protector of the world?
                Going where can we pay homage
                to the Self-Awakened One,
                supreme among two-footed beings?”
              
              
                The devatā:
                “In Sāvatthī, the Kosalan city,
                is the Victor of vast discernment,
                of foremost deep intelligence.
                He, a matchless Sakyan-son,
                effluent-free, a bull among men,
                is an expert in the splitting of heads.”
                Then Bāvarī addressed his students,
                brahmans who had mastered the mantras,
                “Come, students, I will explain.
                Listen to my words.
                He whose appearance in the world
                is hard often to gain,
                has today arisen          in the world,
                renowned as Self-Awakened.
                Going quickly to Sāvatthī,
                see the one supreme
                among two-footed beings.”
              
              
                The students:
                “But how, brahman, on seeing him,
                will we know for sure
                that he’s the One Self-Awakened?
                Tell us, who don’t know,
                how we will know him.”
              
              
                Bāvarī:
                “There have come down in the mantras
                the marks of a Great Man.
                Thirty-two are described in all,
                step by step.
                One in whose body
                are the marks of a Great Man
                has two destinations.
                There isn’t a third.
                If he dwells in a home,
                he will conquer this world
                —without rod, without sword,
                but with righteousness—
                he will rule.
                But if he goes forth
                from home into homelessness,
                with his roof opened up,2
                he will be      Self-Awakened,
                a worthy one     unexcelled.
                Ask just in your heart
                about my caste & clan,
                mantras, other students,
                and about heads
                & the splitting of heads.
                If he is awakened,
                seeing without obstruction,
                he will answer     in speech
                the questions asked     in your heart.”
              
              
                Having heard Bāvarī’s words,
                sixteen brahman students—
                Ajita, Tissa-metteyya,
                Puṇṇaka & Mettagū,

                from previous lives,
                having bowed down to Bāvarī
                and performed circumambulation,
                left, setting out for the North,
                wearing coiled hair & deer-skins:
                first to the establishment of Muḷaka,
                then to Māhissatī, Ujjenī, Gonaddhā,
                Vedisā, Vanasa,
                to Kosambī & Sāketa,
                to Sāvatthī, the supreme city,
                to Setabya, Kapilavatthu,
                the city of Kusinārā,
                to Pāva, Bhoganagara,
                to Vesālī, the city of the Magadhans,
                and then to the Pāsāṇaka shrine,
                refreshing & lovely.
              
              
                Like a thirsty man     for cool water,
                like a merchant     for a great profit,
                like one burning from heat
                for shade,
                quickly they climbed the mountain.
                And at that time, the Blessed One,
                surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks,
                was teaching the monks the Dhamma,
                like a lion roaring in the forest.
                Ajita saw the Self-Awakened One,
                like the sun with radiance in beams,4
                like the moon come to fullness
                on the fifteenth day.
                Then, seeing the marks
                complete in his body,
                he stood to one side, overjoyed,
                and in his heart asked the questions:
              
              
                “Speak concerning his birth,
                speak of his clan & marks,
                speak of his perfection in the mantras,
                and how many brahmans
                does he teach?”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “His age is one hundred & twenty,
                and by clan, he is a Bāvarī.
                Three are the marks in his body,
                three the Vedas he’s mastered.
                In the marks & oral traditions,
                etymologies & rituals,
                he teaches five hundred.
                In his own doctrine
                he has reached perfection.”
              
              
                Ajita:
                “Proclaim them in detail—
                Bāvarī’s marks—
                O man supreme,
                cutter of craving,
                don’t leave us in doubt.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “He can hide his face with his tongue,
                he has a tuft of hair between his brows,
                his male organ is in a sheath:
                Know this, young brahman.”
              
              
                Not hearing anything asked,
                but hearing the questions answered,
                all the people, excited,
                with hands palm-to-palm over their hearts,
                thought:
                “What deva or Brahmā,
                or Inda Sujampati5
                asked those questions in his heart?
                To whom did he [the Buddha] reply?”
              
              
                Ajita:
                “Bāvarī asked about heads
                and the splitting of heads.
                Explain that, Blessed One.
                Subdue our doubt, seer.”
              
              
                The Buddha:
                “Know the head to be ignorance,
                and the splitting of the head, knowledge
                connected with conviction,
                mindfulness, concentration,
                desire, & persistence.”
              
              
                Then, with great joy,
                the young brahman,
                putting himself in order,
                arranging his deer-skin over one shoulder,
                fell with his head at the Blessed One’s feet:
                “Master, One with Eyes,
                Bāvarī the brahman,
                together with his students, dear sir—
                exultant in mind, happy at heart—

                The Buddha:
                “May he be happy,
                Bāvarī the brahman,
                together with his students.
                And may you, too, be happy,
                young brahman,
                and live a long time.

              1. Reading ākiñcāññaṁ with the Thai text of Nd II and of SnA. The Thai text of the prologue here reads āciññaṁ, “practice, custom.” According to SnA, “nothingness” here means freedom from care. However, it might also mean the meditative state of the dimension of nothingness, and the post-mortem deva realm corresponding to that attainment. This would fit in with the fact that, in the following dialogues, two of his students—Upasīva and Posāla—appear to be familiar with this dimension in their meditation, and quiz the Buddha as to what to do after having attained it.
              2. See Sn 2:13, note 3.

              1. The Thai edition notes that this word, in terms of the meter of the line, is excessive.
              2. According to Nd II, the streams that ‘flow every which way’ are the streams of craving, views, conceit, defilement, corruption, and ignorance that flow out the six sense media. The first two lines in the translation of Ven. Ajita’s second set of questions (the first half-line in the Pali) is identical to the first half-line in Dhp 340.
              3. See DN 11, DN 15, MN 49, and SN 12:67. Asaṅga, in the Yogācārabhūmi, quotes a Sanskrit translation of this sutta that inserts at this point the final question and answer, on the topic of how consciousness is brought to a halt, occurring at the end of the Pali version of Sn 5:14. A manuscript found in Turfan contains a Sanskrit version of this sutta that inserts the same question at the same point, and includes traces of other insertions as well.
              4. In SN 12:31, the Buddha quotes this question to Ven. Sāriputta and asks him to answer it. With a little prodding, Ven. Sāriputta gives this extended answer, on which the Buddha places his seal of approval:
              “One sees with right discernment that ‘this has come into being.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘this has come into being,’ one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of what has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment,’ one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of the nutriment by which it has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation,’ one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of what is subject to cessation. This is how one is a learner.
              “And how is one a person who has fathomed the Dhamma?
              “One sees with right discernment that ‘this has come into being.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘this has come into being,’ one is—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, through lack of clinging/sustenance—released from what has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘it has come into being from this nutriment,’ one is—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, through lack of clinging/sustenance—released from the nutriment by which it has come into being. One sees with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation.’ Seeing with right discernment that ‘from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation,’ one is—through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, through lack of clinging/sustenance—released from what is subject to cessation.

              1. AN 6:61 reports a discussion among several elder monks as to what is meant in this poem by “both sides” and “in between.” Six of the elders express the following separate opinions:
              a) Contact is the first side, the origination of contact the second side, and the cessation of contact is in between.
              b) The past is the first side, the future the second, and the present is in between.
              c) Pleasant feeling is the first side, painful feeling the second, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling is in between.
              d) Name (mental phenomena) is the first side, form (physical phenomena) the second, and consciousness is in between.
              e) The six internal sense media (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, intellect) are the first side, the six external sense media (sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, tactile sensations, ideas) the second side, and consciousness is in between.
              f) Self-identity is the first side, the origination of self-identity the second, and the cessation of self-identity is in between.
              The issue is then taken to the Buddha, who states that all six interpretations are well-spoken, but the interpretation he had in mind when speaking the poem was the first.
              On the cessation of contact, see SN 35:117.

                They hoped for, liked,
                longed for,
                so they sacrificed—
                they longed for sensuality,
                dependent on gain.
                I tell you:
                Those who take on the yoke
                of sacrifice,
                impassioned with
                the passion for becoming,
                have not crossed over birth & aging.3
              
              
                Puṇṇaka:
                If those who take on the yoke of sacrifice
                haven’t crossed over birth & aging,
                then who in the world, dear sir,
                of beings divine & human
                has crossed over birth & aging?
                I ask you, Blessed One.
                Please tell me.
              
              
                The Buddha:
                He who has fathomed
                the high & low in the world,
                for whom there is nothing
                perturbing in the world—
                evaporated,4 undesiring,
                untroubled, at peace—
                he, I tell you, has crossed over birth
              
              
                & aging.5
              
            
            vv. 1043–1048",No Introduction,"s
              1. Nd II cites three main ways in which the Buddha has seen the roots: 
              a) He has seen that greed, aversion, and delusion are the roots of what is unskillful, and that lack of greed, lack of aversion, and lack of delusion are the roots of what is skillful. Nd II anchors this point with a reference to AN 6:39, although its quote from that sutta contains two phrases not present in the sutta. Where AN 6:39 reads, “It’s through action born of non-greed, action born of non-aversion, action born of non-delusion that devas are discerned, that human beings are discerned, or any other good destinations,” Nd II reads, “It’s through action born of non-greed, action born of non-aversion, action born of non-delusion that devas are discerned, that human beings are discerned, or any other good destinations for the production of a self-state [attabhāva] in a deva or a human being.” Where AN 6:39 reads, “It’s through action born of greed, action born of aversion, action born of delusion that hell is discerned, that the animal womb is discerned, that the realm of hungry ghosts is discerned, or any other bad destinations,” Nd II reads “It’s through action born of greed, action born of aversion, action born of delusion that hell is discerned, that the animal womb is discerned, that the realm of hungry ghosts is discerned, or any other bad destinations for the production of a self-state in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry ghosts.” If we assume that the extra phrases were originally not present in AN 6:39, the question arises as to why they were added in Nd II. One possible reason is that the compilers of Nd II may have been bothered by AN 6:39’s suggestion that its list of good and bad destinations was not complete—e.g., that there could be other good destinations aside from the realms of devas and human beings—so they tried to close off that possibility.
              b) The Buddha has seen further that all unskillful qualities are rooted in ignorance (here Nd II quotes a passage from SN 20:1: “All qualities that are unskillful, that have a share in what’s unskillful, that side with what’s unskillful, are rooted in ignorance and converge in ignorance. From the uprooting of ignorance, they are all uprooted”). The Buddha has also seen that all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness (here Nd II quotes a passage found in SN 45:79–80, SN 45:82, and SN 46:31: “All qualities that are skillful, that have a share in what’s skillful, that side with what’s skillful, are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is foremost among them”). 
              c) The Buddha has also seen that ignorance is the root of all the factors of dependent co-arising. 
              For another sense in which the Buddha has seen the root, see MN 1. 
              2. See Sn 3:4 for another answer to a very similar question.
              3. On the issue of rebirth in the suttas, see The Truth of Rebirth.
              4. According to Nd II, this means that one’s bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct have evaporated away, along with all one’s defilements.
              5. AN 3:32 and AN 4:41 contain discussions of the last verse in this poem. 
              In AN 3:32, Ven. Ānanda asks the Buddha, “Could it be that a monk could attain a concentration of such a sort such that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, and that he would enter & remain in the awareness-release & discernment-release in which there is no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit?”
              The Buddha answers that it is possible, and that such a concentration can be attained when one is percipient in this way: “This is peace, this is exquisite—the pacification of all fabrications; the relinquishing of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; unbinding.” He then adds that it was in connection to this state of mind that he uttered the last verse in this poem.
              In AN 4:41, the Buddha identifies four ways of developing concentration: “There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here-&-now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.” The Buddha then adds that he uttered the last verse of this poem in connection with these four ways of developing concentration.
              Although the verse does not mention concentration explicitly, the use of the phrase, “nothing perturbing” is apparently a reference to the states of concentration called imperturbable. See MN 102, note 2, and MN 106, note 1.",No Additional

              I ask you, Blessed One.
              Please tell me.
              I regard you as an attainer-of-knowledge,
              developed in mind.
              From what have the many
              forms of stress
              arisen in the world?
              
                The Buddha:
                You ask me
                the source of stress.
                I’ll tell it to you
                as one who discerns.
                From acquisition1 as cause
                the many forms of stress
                come into being in the world.
                Whoever, unknowing,
                makes acquisitions
                —the dullard—
                comes to stress
                again & again.
                Therefore, discerning,
                you shouldn’t create acquisitions
                as you stay focused on
                the birth & origin of stress.2
              
              
                Mettagū:
                What we asked, you’ve expounded.
                Now we ask something else.
                Please tell us.
                How do the enlightened
                cross over the flood of
                birth & aging,
                lamentation & sorrow?
                Please, sage, declare this to me
                as this Dhamma has
                been known by you.
              
              
                The Buddha:
                I will expound to you Dhamma
                —here-&-now,
                not quoted words—
                knowing which, living mindfully,
                you’ll cross over beyond
                entanglement in the world.
              
              
                Mettagū:
                And I relish,     Great Seer,
                that Dhamma     supreme,
                knowing which, living mindfully,
                I’ll cross over beyond
                entanglement in the world.
              
              
                The Buddha:
                Whatever you’re alert to,
                above, below,
                across, in between3:
                Dispelling any delight,
                any entrenchment
                in those things,
                consciousness should not take a stance
                in becoming.4
                The monk who dwells thus
                —mindful, heedful—
                letting go of his sense of mine,
                knowing right here would abandon
                birth & aging,
                lamentation & sorrow,
                stress.
              
              
                Mettagū:
                I relish, Gotama, the Great Seer’s words
                well-expounded, without acquisition,
                for yes, Blessed One,
                you’ve abandoned stress
                as this Dhamma has
                been known by you.
                And they, too, would abandon stress
                those whom you, sage,
                would admonish unceasingly.
                Having met you, I bow down to you,
                Nāga.
                Perhaps you will admonish me
                unceasingly.
              
              
                The Buddha:
                Whoever you recognize
                as a brahman, an attainer-of-knowledge
                possessing nothing,
                unentangled
                in sensuality & becoming—
                yes, he has crossed over this flood.
                Having crossed to the far shore,
                he’s free from rigidity, free
                from doubt.
              
              
                And anyone who has realized,
                who is an attainer-of-knowledge here,
                having unentangled the bond
                to becoming and non-,5
                free of craving,
                untroubled,
                undesiring—he,
                I tell you, has crossed over birth
              
              
                & aging.

              1. On the meaning of “acquisition,” see Sn 3:12, note 2. 
              2. This verse is identical with the second set of verses in Sn 3:12.
              3. Nd II gives six different valid interpretations for ‘above, below, across, in between’:
              a) above = the future; below = the past; across and in between = the present,
              b) above = the deva world; below = hell; across and in between = the human world,
              c) above = skillfulness; below = unskillfulness; across and in between = indeterminate mental qualities,
              d) above = the property of formlessness; below = the property of sensuality; across and in between = the property of form,
              e) above = feelings of pleasure; below = feelings of pain; across and in between = feelings of neither pleasure nor pain,
              f) above = the body from the feet on up; below = the body from the crown of the head on down; across and in between = the middle of the body.
              4. On unestablished consciousness, see SN 12:38, SN 12:63–64, SN 22:53–54, and 22:87.","the discussion of this topic in The Paradox of Becoming, chapter 7.

              1. “Nothingness” here denotes the dimension of nothingness, one of the four levels of mental absorption on formless themes. One attains this level, after surmounting the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, by focusing on the perception, “There is nothing.” MN 26 tells us that Āḷāra Kālāma, the Buddha’s first teacher when the latter was still a Bodhisatta, had attained this level of mental absorption and had thought that it was the highest possible attainment. The Bodhisatta left him upon realizing that it was not true liberation from stress and suffering. Nevertheless, the dimension of nothingness can be used as a basis for the insight leading to that liberation. On this point, see Sn 5:14, below, and AN 9:36. On the strategy of relying on the formless states to cross over the flood, see MN 52, MN 106, MN 111, and AN 9:36.

It’s hardly likely, though, that Jatukaṇṇin would have this idea in mind when speaking to the Buddha for the first time. More likely, he might be alluding to the idea that the Buddha is able to see things, and to understand them for what they are, the moment they arise.
              2. According to Nd II, ‘before’ stands for defilements related to the past, ‘after’ for defilements related to the future, and ‘in between’ for the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, thought-fabrications, sensory consciousness—in the present.",No Additional

                both of sensual desires,
                & of unhappiness,
                the dispelling of sloth,
                the warding off of anxieties,
                equanimity-&-mindfulness purified,
                with inspection of mental qualities
                swift in the forefront:
                That I call the gnosis of emancipation,1
                the breaking open
                of ignorance.2
              
              
                Udaya:
                With what
                is the world fettered?
                With what
                is it examined?
                Through the abandoning of what
                is there said to be
                unbinding?
              
              
                The Buddha:
                With delight
                the world’s fettered.
                With directed thought
                it’s examined.
                Through the abandoning of craving
                is there said to be
                unbinding.
              
              
                Udaya:
                Living mindful in what way
                does one bring consciousness
                to a halt?
                We’ve come to ask
                the Blessed One.
                Let us hear your words.
              
              
                The Buddha:
                Not relishing feeling,
                inside or out:
                One living mindful in this way
                brings consciousness
                to a halt.3
              
            
            vv. 1105–1111",No Introduction,"s
              1. The state of mind described here corresponds to the five-factored noble right concentration described in AN 5:28, and analyzed more fully in AN 9:36. For further discussion, see section III/F in The Wings to Awakening and the essays, “Jhāna Not by the Numbers” and “Silence Isn’t Mandatory.” 
              2. AN 3:33 contains a discussion of this verse. The Buddha tells Ven. Sāriputta that one should train oneself such that “with regard to this conscious body, there will be no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] there will be no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit, and that we will enter & remain in the awareness-release & discernment-release in which there is no ‘I’-making or ‘mine’-making or obsession with conceit.” When one has trained in this way, he says, one is called a person who has cut through craving, unraveled the fetter, who has, through the right penetration of conceit, put an end to suffering and stress. He then states that it was in connection to this state that he uttered this verse.
              3. See DN 11, DN 15, MN 49, and SN 12:67. For a discussion of “bringing consciousness to a halt”—showing that it is not an annihilation of consciousness, but rather the ending of its proliferating activity—see SN 22:53.",the image in SN 12:64.

              who has gone to the beyond
              of all phenomena,
              I’ve come with a desire for a question.
              I ask the Sakyan about the knowledge1
              of one devoid of perception of forms,
              who has abandoned all the body,
              every body,
              who sees, within & without,

                all stations of consciousness,2
                knows for one stationed in them
                release
                & the steps leading there.
              
              
                Knowing directly
                the origin of nothingness
                to be the fetter of delight,
                one then sees there
                clearly.
                That’s his genuine knowledge—
                the brahman who has lived
                to fulfillment.

              1. Posāla’s question concerning the knowledge of the person in the dimension of nothingness has a double meaning: He is asking about the Buddha’s knowledge about that person, and also what a person in that dimension of attainment should do to develop his/her knowledge even further. The Buddha’s answer deals with the question in both its senses. On delight in nothingness, see MN 106. 
              2. On the seven stations of consciousness, see DN 15. The dimension of nothingness, discussed in this dialogue, is the seventh and most refined. See Sn 5:6, note 1.

            That is what the Blessed One said when dwelling among the Magadhans at the Pāsāṇaka shrine. Asked in turn by the sixteen brahmans, he answered their questions. And if one were to practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma,1 knowing the meaning and Dhamma of each of these questions, one would go to the far shore of birth & death. Because these Dhammas lead there, this Dhamma-sequence is called “To the Far Shore.”

              Puṇṇaka & Mettagū,

              Nanda & Hemaka,

              the wise Jatukaṇṇin,
              Bhadrāvudha & Udaya,
              Posāla the brahman,
              Mogharāja the intelligent,
              and Piṅgiya the great seer:
              They went to the Awakened One,
              consummate in conduct, the seer.
              They went to the excellent Awakened One,
              asking subtle questions.
              The Awakened One,
              when asked their questions,
              answered in line with the truth.
              By answering their questions, the sage
              delighted the brahmans.
              They, delighted by the One with Eyes—
              Awakened, Kinsman of the Sun—
              lived the holy life
              in the presence of the one
              of foremost discernment.
              
                Whoever would practice
                as the Awakened One taught
                concerning each of these questions,
                would go from the near shore to the far—
                would go from the near shore to the far
                developing the path supreme.
                The path is for going beyond,
                and so it’s called “To the Far Shore.”

                awakened,

                As a bird leaving a scrubby grove

                the one deeply discerning,
                to that direction I bow down.
                I am old, my stamina frail,
                which is why my body doesn’t run away to there.
                But through the machine of my resolves
                I constantly go,
                for my heart, brahman, is connected to him.
              
              
                Floundering in the mud,
                I swam from island to island,
                but then I saw the One Self-Awakened,
                crossed over the flood, effluent-free.
              
              
                ‘As Vakkali has shown his conviction6—
                as Bhadrāvudha & Āḷavi Gotama too—
                so will you show your conviction, Piṅgiya.

                I feel confidence all the more,
                having heard the words of the sage,
                his roof opened-up, self-awakened,
                quick-witted, free from rigidity.
                Knowing the supreme devas,7

                of those admitting
                their doubt.

              1. See SN 22:39–42.
              2. According to SnA, the sixteen brahmans, after their questions were answered, requested and received the Going-forth and Acceptance. After that, Piṅgiya, now Ven. Piṅgiya, received permission from the Buddha to return to Bāvarī to report the results of their trip.
              3. Reading nikkāmo nibbano nāgo with the Sri Lankan and Burmese versions, a reading confirmed by Nd II. The Thai version has nibbuto, “unbound,” instead of nibbano. The PTS version has nātho, “protector,” instead of nāgo.
              According to Nd II, “no forest” here means free from the forests of passion, aversion, delusion, resentment, and all other unskillful mental fabrications. See Dhp 283.
              4. See SN 35:82, SN 35:116, and AN 4:45.
              5. The phrase, “and gave me no pleasure,” appears in the Thai edition but not the others.
              6. According to Nd IIA, to show conviction means to attain arahantship through the strength of conviction. The expression also occurs in SN 6:1, where it seems to have a more general meaning. Ven. Vakkali’s story appears in SN 22:87. At AN 1:147 (1:208) the Buddha cites him as foremost among the monks in being decisive in his conviction. Bhadrāvudha is apparently the same Bhadrāvudha in Sn 5:12. Āḷavi Gotama is mentioned nowhere else in the Canon.
              7. In AN 8:71 (AN 8:64 in the PTS reckoning), the Buddha states that he did not claim full awakening until his knowledge of the deva world was complete.

This style, which became common in later Indian literature because it was considered to convey strength, is uncommonly “strong” for a verse in the Pali Canon. For a similar example, see Dhp 39.
              “Effluent” here is a translation of the term āsava, which stands for three tendencies that “flow out” of the mind and lead to the flood of rebirth: sensuality, becoming, and ignorance. The Jains, contemporaries of the Buddha, also used the term “effluent” in their teachings, but the Buddhist use of the term differed from theirs in two important respects. First, for the Buddhists, effluents were mental, whereas for the Jains they were physical: sticky substances that kept what they regarded as the soul attached to the process of transmigration. Second, for the Jains a living person could become freed of the effluents only at his/her final death. Thus a living person could not be effluent-free. For the Buddhists, however, one became effluent-free at the point of total awakening. Thus a living arahant was effluent-free. Many of the speakers in the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā speak of themselves as effluent-free—see, for instance,Thag 18, Thig 5:11, Thig 14—which means that they are employing the concept in its strictly Buddhist sense.",: SN 47:6–7

                cleanses, back for seven generations,
                the family in which he’s born.
                I would imagine you to be Sakka,5 the deva of devas
                for you engendered a sage truly named.
              
              
                Suddhodana is the name of the Great Seer’s father,
                and Māyā name of the Buddha’s mother6
                who, having nurtured the bodhisatta with her womb,
                at the break-up of the body, rejoices in the threefold divine realm.7
              
              
                She, Gotamī, having passed away,
                having fallen away from here,
                is now endowed with heavenly sensual pleasures.
                She rejoices in the five strings of sensuality,
                surrounded by those groups of devas.
              
              
                I am the son of the Buddha,
                who endures what is hard to endure—
                Aṅgīrasa8: incomparable, Such.
                You, Sakka, are my father’s father.
                In the Dhamma, Gotama,
                you are my grandfather.","KN/Thag/10:1
            This is a poem in at least two parts. In the first part, Ven. Kāludāyin is addressing the Buddha soon after the latter’s awakening, inviting him to return home to visit his family. In the second part, Kāludāyin is addressing the Buddha’s father, Suddhodana, at the time of the Buddha’s return, perhaps to make Suddhodana favorably inclined to receive his son.
            There is a question, though, as to where the first part ends and the second begins. The Commentary assigns only the last stanza—beginning with, “I am the son of the Buddha”—to the second part, and everything before that to the first. This, however, doesn’t fit with the fact that the seventh stanza is obviously addressed to the person who engendered the Buddha, and not to the Buddha himself. For this reason, I have placed the division into two parts after the sixth stanza, as the first six stanzas are unified by the theme of bearing fruit, with the fourth and fifth stanzas possibly included to remind the Buddha of the good results that would come to his family if he provided them with the opportunity to give him alms. Alternatively, the division could be placed after the fourth stanza, in that the fifth stanza could be interpreted as beginning a line of thought aimed at putting the listener into the proper mood to accept the principle of the results of good kamma seen not in this lifetime but in the next.
            
              Covered in embers now are the trees,
              shedding their canopy, lord, in search of fruit.
              As if flaring up, they glow.
              The time, great hero, partakes of savors.
              
                The trees in bloom, delightful,
                waft delights
                all around, in all directions,
                dropping their petals in hope of fruit.
                Now, O hero, is the time to set forth.
              
              
                Neither too cold nor too hot:
                pleasant the season, lord, fit for a journey.

                bringing back wealth.
                Let the hope in which I stand bear fruit.2
              
              
                Again & again      they sow the seed.3
                Again & again      the deva-kings rain.
                Again & again      farmers plow the fields.
                Again & again      grain comes to the kingdom.
              
              
                Again & again      beggars wander.
                Again & again      lords of giving give.
                Again & again      having given, the lords of giving
                again & again      go to the heavenly place.","s

              5. Sakka is the name of the king of the devas of the heaven of the Thirty-three. Ven. Kāludāyin is playing here with the similarity between this name and that of the Sakyan lineage.
              6. Reading Māyanāmā with the Sri Lankan and PTS editions. The Thai edition reads Māyā mahesī, so that the line would read, “The Buddha’s mother is Queen Māyā.” This would provide a play on words—mahesi, great seer, and mahesī, queen—but there is nothing in the early suttas to indicate that Suddhodana was a king, or Māyā a queen.
              7. The Commentary identifies the threefold divine realm as the Tusita (Contented) heaven, but doesn’t explain why that heaven would be given this name. Some verses in the Jātaka identify the threefold divine realm as the heaven of the Thirty-three, and the later reference to “those groups of devas” in this poem would seem to support this latter interpretation.
              8. An epithet for the Buddha, meaning “resplendent.” Aṅgīrasa was the name of an ancient brahmanical sage to which the Gotama clan claimed a connection. The Commentary suggests that this was one of the bodhisatta’s personal names prior to his awakening.",No Additional

            This poem, which is attributed to King Asoka’s younger brother, falls into three parts: The first expresses his initial desire to leave the life of the palace and go into the forest; the second depicts his going forth; and the third announces his awakening. Some scholars have suggested that many of the poems dealing with events in the lives of the early Buddhist monks and nuns may have originally been intended for dramatic performance, and this poem could easily have been written with that intent. The language of the original, with its heavy use of poetic terms, certainly indicates that the author had a literary background and was writing for a sophisticated audience.

            Ven. Saṅkicca ordained as a novice at the age of seven, and is reported to have attained arahantship as his head was being shaved prior to his ordination. In the first of the following verses attributed to him, he engages himself in a rhetorical conversation while sitting in a rainy forest.
            
              What do you want in the woods, my boy,
              like a bird1 exposed to the rain?

                drives the clouds in the rainy season,

              1. Ujjuhāna. The Commentary offers two interpretations for this word. The first is that it is a hill covered with jungle and many streams that tended to overflow in the rainy season. The other is that it is the name of a bird that could stay comfortable even when exposed to cold, wind, and rain. I’ve chosen the second alternative. K. R. Norman speculates that the term could be written ujjahāna, in which case it would be the present participle for a verb meaning “abandoned” or “cast off.” However, none of the manuscripts support his speculation.

              that in this world is well-mastered,
              for virtue, when cultivated,
              brings every consummation near.
              
                Wise, one should protect one’s virtue,
                aspiring to three pleasures:
                praise, the gaining of wealth,
                and—after death—rejoicing in heaven.
              
              
                The virtuous one, through restraint,
                acquires many friends,
                while the unvirtuous one, practicing evil,
                from friends is estranged.
              
              
                The unvirtuous person gains
                disrepute & dishonor;
                the virtuous person, always,

              Into a lowly family I was born,
              poor, with next to no food.
              My work was degrading:
              I gathered the spoiled,
              the withered flowers from shrines
              and threw them away.
              People found me disgusting,
              despised me, disparaged me.
              Lowering my heart,
              I showed reverence to many.
              
                Then I saw the One Self-awakened,
                arrayed with a squadron of monks,
                the Great Hero, entering the city,
                supreme, of the Magadhans.
                Throwing down my carrying pole,
                I approached him to do reverence.
                He—the supreme man—stood still
                out of sympathy
                just
                for me.
                After paying homage
                to the feet of the teacher,
                I stood to one side
                & requested the Going Forth from him,
                supreme among all living beings.
              
              
                The compassionate Teacher,
                sympathetic to all the world, said:
                “Come, monk.”
                That was my formal Acceptance.
              
              
                Alone, I stayed in the wilds,
                untiring,
                I followed the Teacher’s words,
                just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.
              
              
                In the first watch of the night,
                I recollected previous lives;
                in the middle watch,
                purified the divine eye;
                in the last,
                burst the mass of darkness.
              
              
                Then, as night was ending
                & the sun returning,
                Indra & Brahmā came to pay homage to me,
                hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:

                Seeing me,
                arrayed with a squadron of devas,
                the Teacher smiled & said:

          Soṇa, gone beyond suffering.
          
            Five should be cut, five abandoned,
            and five above all developed.
            Having gone past five bonds,2
            a monk is said to be
            one who’s crossed over.
          
          
            For a monk who is insolent, heedless,
            wishing for what’s outside,
            virtue, concentration, & discernment
            don’t go to completion,
            because what should be done is cast        aside,
            what shouldn’t be done        is done.
            For those who are insolent, heedless,
            their effluents increase.
          
          
            But those whose mindfulness immersed in the body
            is constantly well-undertaken,
            —who don’t engage in what shouldn’t be done,
            who persevere in what should be done,
            mindful, alert—
            their effluents go to their end.
          
          
            Go by the straight path pointed out,
            don’t turn back.
            You yourself should reprove yourself3
            should advance to unbinding.
          
          
            When I overexerted my effort,
            the Teacher unexcelled in the world,
            the One with Eyes,
            making the lute simile,
            taught me the Dhamma.
            I, having heard his words,
            dwelled delighting in his bidding.
            I practiced in tune,4
            attaining the foremost goal.
            The three knowledges are attained.
            The Buddha’s bidding, done.
          
          
            When one’s awareness is dedicated5
            to renunciation, seclusion,
            non-afflictiveness, the ending of clinging,
            the ending of craving, & non-deludedness,
            seeing the arising of the sense media,
            the mind is rightly released.
            For that monk, rightly released,
            his heart at peace.
            There’s nothing to be done,
            nothing to add
            to what’s done.

            ideas desirable & not,
            have no effect on one who is Such.
            The mind

            their passing away.",No Introduction,"s
          1. Ven. Soṇa’s story is told in AN 6:55 and Mv V.1. The Mahāvagga version states that he was a native of Aṅga, but says nothing about his having been in the service of the king.
          2. According to the Commentary, the five that should be cut are the five lower fetters; the five that should be abandoned are the five higher fetters (see AN 10:13); the five that should be developed are the five faculties: conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment (see SN 48:10). The five bonds are passion, aversion, delusion, conceit, and views.
          3. This line also appears in Dhp 379.
          4. The Thai, Burmese, and Sri Lankan editions here read samathaṁ, “tranquility.” However, I have chosen to follow the PTS edition in reading samataṁ, “in tune,” which seems to fit better with the message of the simile. Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and actions.

              Since I went forth
              from home into homelessness,
              I haven’t known
              an ignoble, aversive resolve.
              “May these beings
              be destroyed,
              be slaughtered,
              fall into pain”—
              I’ve not known this resolve
              in this long, long time.
              But I have known goodwill,
              unlimited,
              fully developed,
              nurtured step after step,
              as taught by the One
              Awake:
              to all, a friend;
              to all, a comrade;
              for all beings, sympathetic.1
              
                And I develop a mind of goodwill,
                delighting in non-malevolence
                —always.
                Unvanquished, unshaken,
                I gladden the mind.
                I develop the sublime abiding,
                not frequented by
                the lowly.
              
              
                Attaining no-thinking,
                the disciple of the Rightly
                Self-awakened One
                is endowed with noble silence2

                is unmoving,
                firmly established,
                so a monk,
                with the ending of delusion,
                like a mountain,
                doesn’t quake.
              
              
                To a person without blemish,
                in constant quest of what’s pure,
                a hair-tip of evil
                seems a storm cloud.
              
              
                As a frontier fortress is guarded
                within & without,
                you should safeguard yourselves.
                Don’t let the moment
                pass you by.
              
              
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time
                like a worker his wage.
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time,
                mindful, alert.
              
              
                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;
                the heavy load,       laid down;
                the guide to becoming,   uprooted.
                And the goal for which I went forth
                from home life into homelessness
                I’ve reached:
                the end
                of all fetters.

                through heedfulness:
                That is my message.
              
              
                So then, I’m about to

              2. Noble silence = the second jhāna.
              3. AN 3:77 and AN 3:78 use the analogy of a field to describe becoming, in which kamma is the field, craving the moisture, and consciousness the seed. The logic of the analogy suggests that if consciousness is not watered by craving, and does not land in any place (see SN 12:64), it is like a seed without moisture or a field. Therefore it will not sprout into further becoming. Poems in the Canon often describe the arahant as being “everywhere released” (sabbattha vimutto—see Dhp 348) or “everywhere independent” (sabbattha anissito—see Sn 4:6), referring indirectly to this analogy. Translators, lacking a sense of the underlying image of the idiom, have tended to render it in more prosaic terms: “completely released in every respect,” “not dependent on anything,” “released from everything.” However, in light of the field analogy, the idiom means precisely what it says: The arahant is released from every possible “where,” whether fabricated or not—every possible spot for renewed becoming.",No Additional

              A human being, self-awakened,
              his mind tamed, concentrated,
              traveling along the Brahmā road,
              delighting in the stilling of the mind:
              He, having gone beyond all dhammas,1
              to whom human beings pay homage,
              the devas pay homage as well—
              so I have heard from the Worthy One
              —to him, gone past all fetters,
              gone from the forest to the clearing,2
              delighting in the renunciation of sensuality,
              released like gold from its ore.
              
                He, the nāga outshining all others,
                as the Himalayas, rocky hills:
                Among all things named nāga,
                he, unexcelled, is truly named.
              
              
                I will praise the nāga to you—
                for he does no misdeed.
                Composure & harmlessness
                are the nāga’s two feet.
                Austerity & celibacy
                are the nāga’s two other feet.
                Conviction is the great nāga’s trunk,
                his hand;3
                equanimity, his white tusks.
                Mindfulness his neck; his head:
                discernment,
                discrimination,
                reflection on dhammas;
                Dhamma the balanced heat of his digestion;
                seclusion his tail.
                He, in jhāna, delighting in assurance,
                inwardly well-concentrated,
                the nāga, when going,       is concentrated,
                when standing, the nāga     is concentrated,
                when reclining, the nāga     is concentrated,
                when sitting, the nāga       is concentrated.
                Everywhere he’s restrained, the nāga:
                That is the nāga’s consummation.
              
              
                He eats what is blameless;
                doesn’t eat what is not;
                on gaining food & clothing,
                doesn’t store it up.
                Having cut all bonds,
                fetters tiny & large,
                wherever he goes,
                he goes without longing.
                Like a white lotus, born & growing in the water,
                but not smeared by the water
                —fragrant, delightful—
                even so the awakened one,
                well-born in the world, lives in the world,
                but is not smeared by the world,
                like the lotus, by the water.
              
              
                A great blazing fire
                unnourished grows calm,
                and though its embers exist4
                is described as unbound:
                Conveying an instructive meaning,
                this image is taught by the observant.
                Great nāgas will recognize
                the nāga as taught by the nāga
                as free from passion,
                free from aversion,
                free from delusion,
                effluent-free.
                His body discarded, the nāga
                will, without effluent,
                totally unbind.","            In AN 6:43, Ven. Udāyin recites these verses spontaneously in the Buddha’s presence after the king’s elephant (nāga) has passed by, and the Buddha defines the foremost nāga in these terms: “But, Udāyin, whoever in this world—with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, its people with their contemplatives & brahmans, their royalty & commonfolk—does no misdeed in body, speech, or mind: That’s whom I call a nāga.” The Buddha’s definition hints at a play on words: “Does no misdeed,” in Pali, is āguṁ na karoti, which could be rephrased as na āguṁ karoti, yielding a play on the word nāga. In these verses, Ven. Udāyin shows that he has picked up on the hint by rephrasing it in precisely that way.

              1. On the point that arahants have gone beyond all dhammas, see AN 3:137, note 1.
              2. Clearing = nibbāna, which is here presented as a play on the word, vana, or forest.
              3. In Pali, an elephant’s trunk is called its “hand” (hattha). In fact, one of the words for “elephant” is hatthin, “one having a hand.”
              4. Aṅgāresu ca santesu. The phrase is apparently meant as a play on words, in that santesu can be the locative either of santa, calm, or sant, existing. Either possibility fits into what seems to be point of this last section of the poem, which is to provide an image to illustrate the difference between the sa-upādisesa-nibbāna of the living arahant—literally, unbinding with fuel remaining—and the anupādisesa-nibbāna of the arahant who has passed away—literally, unbinding with no fuel remaining. In other words, the unbinding of the living arahant is like a fire that has grown calm and whose embers are calm but still warm; the unbinding of the arahant after death is like a fire whose embers have grown totally cold.
              Iti 44 describes the property of sa-upādisesa-nibbāna as follows: “His [the arahant’s] five sense faculties still remain and, owing to their being intact, he experiences the pleasing & the displeasing, and is sensitive to pleasure & pain. His ending of passion, aversion, & delusion is termed the unbinding property with fuel remaining.” Its description of the property of anupādisesa-nibbāna is: “For him, all that is sensed, being unrelished, will grow cold right here. This is termed the unbinding property with no fuel remaining.” For further discussion of this distinction, see The Mind Like Fire Unbound, chapter 1.",: MN 1; SN 12:51; AN 6:43; AN 9:7; AN 9:62; AN 10:81; Iti 44

                One gone to the far shore
                without clinging,
                effluent-free,
                his task completed,
                welcomes the ending of life,
                as if freed from a place of execution.
                Having attained the supreme Rightness,
                unconcerned with all the world,
                as if released from a burning house,
                he doesn’t sorrow at death.
              
              
                Whatever’s compounded,
                wherever a state of becoming’s obtained,
                all that has no one in charge:
                So says the Great Seer.
                Whoever discerns this,
                as taught by the Awakened One,
                would no more grasp hold
                of any state of becoming
                than he would
                a hot iron ball.
                I have no ‘I was,’
                no ‘I will be.’
                Fabrications will simply
                go out of existence.
                What’s to lament there in that?
                For one who sees, as it actually is,
                the pure arising of phenomena,
                the pure seriality of fabrications,
                there’s no fear.
              
              
                When seeing the world,
                with discernment,
                as on a par
                with grass & twigs,
                finding no ‘mine-ness,’
                thinking, ‘There’s nothing of mine,’
                he feels no sorrow.
                Dissatisfied with this carcass,
                I’m unconcerned with becoming.
                This body will break up
                and there will not be another.
                Do as you like with this carcass.
                From that I will feel
                neither hatred nor love.”
              
              
                Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,
                the young men threw down their weapons & said:
              
              
                “What have you done, sir,
                or who have you taken as mentor?
                Because of whose teachings
                is this lack of sorrow acquired?”
              
              
                Ven. Adhimutta:
                “The all-knowing,
                all-seeing conqueror:
                He is my mentor.
                Greatly compassionate teacher,
                all the world’s healer,
                this doctrine is his,
                unexcelled, leading to ending.
                Because of his teachings
                is this lack of sorrow acquired.”
              
              
                The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,
                threw down their swords & their weapons.
                Some relinquished their life of crime,
                some chose the Going-forth.
                Having gone forth in the teachings

                people with wealth
                who, from delusion,
                don’t make a gift
                of the treasure they’ve gained.
                Greedy, they stash it away,
                hoping for even more
                sensual pleasures.
              
              
                A king who, by force,
                has conquered the world
                and rules over the earth
                to the edge of the sea,
                dissatisfied with the ocean’s near shore,
                longs for the ocean’s
                far shore as well.
              
              
                Kings & others
                —plenty of people—
                go to death with craving
                unabated. Unsated,
                they leave the body behind,
                having not had enough
                of the world’s sensual pleasures.
              
              
                One’s relatives weep
                & pull out their hair.
                ‘Oh woe, our loved one is dead,’ they cry.
                Carrying him off,
                wrapped in a piece of cloth,
                they place him
                on a pyre,
                then set him on fire.
              
              
                So he burns, poked with sticks,
                in just one piece of cloth,
                leaving all his possessions behind.
                They are not shelters for one who has died—
                not relatives,
                friends,
                or companions.
              
              
                Heirs take over his wealth,
                while the being goes on,
                in line with his kamma.
                No wealth at all
                follows the dead one—
                not children, wives,
                dominion, or riches.
              
              
                Long life
                can’t be gotten with wealth,
                nor aging
                warded off with treasure.
                The wise say this life
                is next to nothing—
                impermanent,
                subject to change.
              
              
                The rich & the poor
                touch the touch of Death.
                The foolish & wise
                are touched by it, too.
                But while fools lie as if slain by their folly,
                the wise don’t tremble
                when touched by the touch.
              
              
                Thus the discernment by which
                one attains to mastery,
                is better than wealth—
                for those who haven’t reached mastery
                go from existence to existence,
                out of delusion,
                doing bad deeds.
              
              
                One goes to a womb
                & to the next world,
                falling into the wandering on
                —one thing
                after another—
                while those of weak discernment,
                trusting in one,
                also go to a womb
                & to the next world.
              
              
                Just as an evil thief
                caught at the break-in
                is destroyed
                by his own act,
                so evil people
                —after dying, in the next world—
                are destroyed
                by their own acts.
              
              
                Sensual pleasures—
                variegated,
                enticing,
                sweet—
                in various ways disturb the mind.
                Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects:
                that’s why, O king, I went forth.
              
              
                Just like fruits, people fall
                —young & old—
                at the break-up of the body.
                Knowing this, O king,
                I went forth.
                The contemplative life is better
                for sure.3
              
              
                  
                Out of conviction,
                I went forth
                equipped with the Victor’s message.
                Blameless4 was my going-forth:
                Debtless I eat my food.
              
              
                Seeing sensuality as burning,
                gold as a knife,
                pain in the entry into the womb
                & great danger in hells—
                seeing this peril, I was then dismayed—
                pierced (with dismay),
                then calmed
                on attaining the end of the effluents.
                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;

                from home life into homelessness
                I’ve reached:

            The verses here fall into three sections, with the first two relating to Raṭṭhapāla’s story as told in MN 82. In the first, Raṭṭhapāla is addressing his father after the latter had tried to use wealth and Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives to lure Ratthapala into disrobing. In the second section, Raṭṭhapāla is talking to King Koravya, who had asked him why he had ordained when he was still young and healthy, and had suffered no loss of relatives or wealth.

              Look at the image beautified,
              a heap of festering wounds, shored up:
              ill, but the object
              of many resolves,
              where there is nothing
              lasting or sure.1

                Feet reddened with henna,

                but not a seeker for the further shore.
              
              
                Hair plaited in eight pleats,

                The hunter set out the snares,

                Who once was heedless,
                but later is not,
                brightens the world
                like the moon set free from a cloud.1
                His evil-done deed
                is replaced with skillfulness:
                He brightens the world

                He brightens the world

                May even my enemies
                devote themselves
                to the Buddha’s bidding.
                May even my enemies
                associate with those people
                who—peaceful, good—
                get others to accept the Dhamma.
                May even my enemies
                hear the Dhamma time & again
                from those who advise     endurance,
                forbearance,
                who praise non-opposition,
                and may they follow it.
              
              
                For surely he wouldn’t harm me,
                or anyone else;
                he would attain     the foremost peace,
                would protect     the feeble & firm.

                Swept along by a great flood,
                I went to the Buddha as refuge.
              
              
                Bloody-handed
                I used to be,

                See my going for refuge!
                Uprooted is [craving],

                touched by the fruit of [that] kamma,
                unindebted, I eat my food.4
              
              
                They’re addicted to heedlessness
                —dullards, fools—
                while one who is wise
                cherishes heedfulness

                Don’t give way to heedlessness
                or to intimacy
                with sensual delight—
                for a heedful person,

                attains an abundant bliss.6

                This has come well & not gone away,

                sense-doors guarded, well-restrained,
                having killed the root of evil,

            Aṅgulumāla’s story is told in MN 86.
            
              Aṅgulimāla:
              “While walking, contemplative,
              you say, ’I have stopped.’
              But when I have stopped
              you say that I haven’t.
              I ask you the meaning of this:
              How have you stopped?
              How haven’t I?”
              
                The Buddha:
                “I have stopped, Aṅgulimāla,
                once & for all,
                having cast off violence
                toward all living beings.
                You, though,
                are unrestrained toward beings.
                That’s how I’ve stopped
                and you haven’t.”
              
              
                Aṅgulimāla:
                “At long last a greatly revered great seer
                for my sake
                has come to the great forest.
                Having heard your verse
                in line with the Dhamma,

                So saying, the bandit
                hurled his sword & weapons
                over a cliff
                into a chasm,

              4. This verse illustrates the kammic principle stated in AN 3:101. This is one of the ways in which the Buddhist doctrine of kamma differed from that of the Jains. For them, a person could not reach arahantship without having suffered retribution for every kammic misdeed, a process that could take many lifetimes—in the course of which, one might create more bad kamma, delaying arahantship still further. But for the Buddhists, training in virtue, discernment, and the ability not to be overcome by pleasure or pain could take the mind to a state where the results of past bad kamma would “be experienced in the here-and-now, and for the most part would appear only for a moment.” In other words, in the Buddhist teaching, but not in the Jain, the state of the mind in the present plays a major role in how the effects of past kamma will be experienced.

          He’s called a monk.
          
            Eating moist or dry food,
            he shouldn’t be heavily sated.
            With unfilled belly, with measured food,
            the monk should wander
            mindfully.
          
          
            Leaving four or five mouthfuls uneaten,
            he should drink water:
            This is enough

            of a resolute monk.
          
          
            Whoever sees pleasure as pain,
            and pain as an arrow,

            With what will he be what in the world?

            But whoever, abandoning objectification,
            delighting in the path of non-objectification,
            attains unbinding,

            as the breeze,
            a leaf from a tree.10
          
          
            Calmed, restrained,
            giving counsel unruffled,
            he removed evil qualities—
            as the breeze,
            a leaf from a tree.
          
          
            You shouldn’t trust in this way
            some householders or those gone forth.
            Having been good, they become bad.
            Having been bad, they become good.
          
          
            Sensual desire, ill will,
            sloth & torpor,
            restlessness & uncertainty:
            These, for a monk, are the five defilements.
          
          
            The concentration of one
            dwelling in heedfulness
            doesn’t waver,
            whether he is honored or not.
            Doing jhāna, persevering,
            having
            subtle insight into
            subtle views,
            delighting in the ending of clinging:
            He’s called a man of integrity.
          
          
            The great ocean, the Earth,
            a mountain, even the wind
            aren’t fitting as a comparison
            for the Teacher’s foremost release.
          
          
            Keeping the (Dhamma) wheel going,
            the elder of great knowledge, centered,
            being like earth, fire, & water,
            is neither impassioned nor angered.11
          
          
            Having attained perfection in discernment,12
            greatly intelligent, a great sage,
            not dull, though seemingly dull,
            he always wanders        unbound.
          
          
            The Teacher has been served by me;
            the Awakened One’s bidding,
            done;
            the heavy load,        laid down;
            the guide to becoming,        uprooted.
          
          
            Attain consummation
            through heedfulness:
            That is my message.
            So then, I’m about to
            unbind.
            I’m released
            everywhere.13"," This is not a single, unified poem. Instead, it is a compilation of verses that—apparently over the course of many years—became associated with Ven. Sāriputta’s name. Some of them may have been his original compositions. Others are verses that other people spoke about him. One in particular is also found in Ud 3:4, where the Buddha is said to have exclaimed it on seeing Sāriputta meditating. Some of the verses that make no mention of Sāriputta are, in other parts of the Canon, attributed to the Buddha, suggesting that they might have been those that Sāriputta’s liked to repeat.
        One of the verses, toward the end of the collection, makes reference to the perfection of discernment. The teaching on the perfections is elsewhere found only in later additions to the Canon, suggesting that this compilation as a whole was also late. This, however, does not rule out the possibility that some of the individual verses were early.
        Also, it should be noted that a large number of the verses here are also found in Thag 14:1. This pattern of borrowing that occurs from one poem to another is a common occurrence in the Theragāthā, suggesting that the compilers of the collection felt no qualms about standardizing the sentiments of the great elders.

                I entered the city for alms,

                He, with his rotting hand,
                tossed me a morsel of food,
                and as the morsel was dropping,
                a finger fell off
                right there.
              
              
                Sitting next to a wall,

                The color of blue-dark clouds,

                There is no such pleasure for me
                in the music of a five-piece band
                as there is when my mind
                is at one,
                seeing the Dhamma
                aright.
              
              
                  
                One shouldn’t do lots of work,
                should avoid people,
                shouldn’t busy oneself.
                He’s eager & greedy for flavors,
                whoever misses the goal
                that brings bliss.
              
              
                One shouldn’t do lots of work,
                should avoid
                what doesn’t lead to the goal.
                The body gets wearied,
                fatigued.
                Aching, one finds
                no tranquility.
              
              
                  
                Simply by flapping the mouth
                one doesn’t see
                even oneself.
                One goes around stiff-
                necked,
                thinking, ‘I’m better
                than they.’
              
              
                Not better,
                he thinks himself better,
                the fool:
                The wise don’t praise him,
                the stiff-necked man.
              
              
                But whoever isn’t stirred
                by the modes of
                ‘I’m better,
                not better.
                I’m worse.
                I’m like that’;
                one who’s discerning,
                who acts as he says,
                well-centered
                in virtues,
                committed to
                tranquility of awareness, he
                is the one
                the wise
                would praise.
              
              
                One with no respect
                for his fellows in the holy life,
                is as far
                from true Dhamma
                as the earth
                from the sky.
              
              
                But those whose sense of shame
                & compunction
                are always rightly established: They
                have flourished in the holy life.
                For them
                there’s no further becoming.
              
              
                A monk conceited & vain,
                even though clad
                in a robe of cast-off rags,
                like a monkey in a lion’s skin,
                doesn’t shine because of it.
              
              
                But a monk not conceited
                or vain,
                masterful,
                his faculties restrained, shines
                because of his robe of cast-off rags,
                like a lion
                in the cleft of a mountain.

                all of Brahmā’s retinue,
                stand with their hands over their hearts,
                paying homage to Sāriputta,
                the Dhamma-general,
                enlightened,4
                centered,
                great master of jhāna,

                ‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.
                Homage to you, O superlative man—
                of whom we have no direct knowledge
                even of that
                in dependence on which
                you do jhāna.

                though we have come
                as hair-splitting archers.’
                Seeing Sāriputta,

                As far as this buddha-field6 extends
                —except for the great sage himself—
                I’m the one
                outstanding
                in ascetic qualities.
                There’s no one else

                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;
                the heavy load,       laid down;

              1. This passage has often been misread as saying that the leper’s finger fell into Mahā Kassapa’s bowl, and that Mahā Kassapa actually ate the finger. Nothing in the verse, though, indicates that this is so. It simply says that the finger fell off, and that Mahā Kassapa ate the food. Furthermore, there is a rule in the Mahāvagga—Mv.VI.23.9—that imposes a grave offense on any monk who eats human flesh. So it’s highly unlikely that Mahā Kassapa ate the leper’s finger.

            5. Ven. Sāriputta was foremost among the monks in terms of discernment (AN 1:183); Ven. Kappina, foremost among the monks in exhorting other monks (AN 1:231). The Buddha praises him at SN 21:11 for his attainment of psychic powers, and at SN 54:7 for the solidity of his concentration based on mindfulness of breathing.
            6. This appears to be one of the earliest references to “buddha-field,” a concept that was to play a large role in the Apadāna literature and, through that, in the Mahāyāna concept of the Pure Land. Here it appears to mean the sphere of the current Buddha’s influence. In the Apadānas it takes on two other meanings: as (1) a field for producing merit, on the lines of the traditional image of the Saṅgha as the unexcelled field of merit; and (2) a heavenly realm where a particular Buddha dwells. These two meanings were influential in the early Mahāyāna sūtras that formed the basis for Pure Land practice.

Since Vedic times, there has been a belief in India that the eyes of holy individuals where particularly powerful because they could see so deeply into reality.

Thus, to be gazed on by such an individual, or to gaze into that individual’s eyes, was considered to be very auspicious.

              Being a co-wife is painful.

              In the midst of a breech-birth
              both [mother & child] suffer destruction.
            
            
              Going along, about to give birth,
              I saw my husband       dead.
              Giving birth in the road,
              I hadn’t reached
              my own home.
              Two children deceased,
              my husband dead in the road
              —miserable me!
              My mother, father, & brother
              were burning on a single pyre.
            
            
              “Your family all gone, miserable,
              you’ve suffered pain without measure.
              Your tears have flowed
              for many thousands of lives.”1
            
            
              Then I saw,
              in the midst of the charnel ground,2
              the muscles of sons being chewed.
            
            
              With family killed,
              despised by all,
              my husband dead,
              I reached the deathless.
              I’ve developed this path,
              noble, eightfold,
              going to the deathless.
              Having realized unbinding,
              I’ve gazed in the mirror of Dhamma.
              I’ve extracted the arrow,3
              put down the burden,
              done the task.
            
            
              I, Kīsā Gotamī Therī,
              my heart well released,
              have said this.","Kīsā Gotamī has two of the most heart-rending stories in the Buddhist tradition associated with her name. The Commentary to this verse tells that when her young child had died, she refused to believe it was dead. After asking many people—in vain—for medicine that would revive the child, she was finally directed to the Buddha. When she told him her story, he offered to provide medicine for the child, but he would need some mustard seed—the cheapest Indian spice—obtained from a family in which no one had died. She went from house to house asking for mustard seed, and no one refused to give it to her. But when she asked if anyone had died in the family, the universal response was always, “Oh, yes, of course.” After a while, the message sunk in: Death is universal. On abandoning the child’s body to a charnel ground, she returned to the Buddha and asked to be ordained as a nun, and afterwards became an arahant.
          The canonical verses associated with Kīsā Gotamī’s name, however, tell a different story, which is identical to the story that the Commentary attributes to Paṭācārā: Pregnant with her second child, she was returning to her parents’ home, along with her husband and young firstborn child, to give birth. Along the way, a great storm blew up, and she asked her husband to provide shelter for the family. As he was cutting grass and gathering sticks to build a shelter, a snake bit him and he died of the poison. Unsheltered, and wondering at her husband’s long absence, Paṭācārā gave birth and had to spend the night sheltering both her children against the rain and wind with nothing more than her body. The next morning, she found her husband dead. Distraught, she decided to return to her parents’ home. However, a river—swollen from the rain of the previous night—ran across her way. Unable to carry both children across the river in one trip, she left her first-born on the near bank and waded through the raging current carrying her baby. Placing the baby on the far bank, she turned back to fetch her first-born. A hawk, seeing the baby, took it for a piece of flesh, and swooped down on it. Seeing this, Paṭācārā raised her hands and tried to chase it away, but to no avail: The hawk picked up the baby and carried it off. Meanwhile, her first-born—seeing his mother raising her hands—took it for a signal to cross the river. Jumping into the raging current, he was carried off to his death. Overwhelmed with grief, Paṭācārā returned to her parents’ home, only to learn that it had burned down from a lightning strike in the previous night’s storm. Her parents and brother were at that moment being cremated on a single pyre. At this point, she went mad and began wandering around half-naked. Only on coming into the Buddha’s presence did she recover her senses. He taught her the Dhamma, and eventually she ordained and became an arahant.
          Why this story is attributed to Paṭācārā in the Commentary when it is obviously Kīsā Gotamī’s in the Canon, is hard to tell. Some scholars have suggested that the tales in the Pāli commentaries were imported from other Buddhist traditions, such as the Mūlasarvāstivādin. Thus, the differences between the canonical verses and the commentarial tales stem from the fact that the different traditions attributed particular stories to different elder monks and nuns. For instance, the Pali Canon attributed the story of the woman whose family was destroyed in a single day to Kīsā Gotamī, while the tradition from which the Commentary drew attributed it to Paṭācārā. If that’s the case, it’s interesting to note how the commentators who adopted these tales nevertheless remained faithful to their Canon. Instead of trying to change the Pali to fit with the commentarial source on which they drew, they allowed the discrepancies between the two sources to stand: one of many instances in which the discrepancies between the Canon and the commentaries suggest that the monks who handed down the Pali Canon tried to keep it intact even when they didn’t agree with it.
          Later Theravādin texts have tried to cover over the discrepancies between Kīsā Gotamī’s verses and the Commentary to those verses by insisting that the passage in the verses beginning, “Going along, about to give birth,” and ending, “my husband dead, I reached the deathless,” is actually Paṭācārā speaking, but this seems unlikely: Why would one arahant butt in on another one’s tale?
          At any rate, regardless of which story is Paṭācārā’s, and which Kīsā Gotamī’s, both speak to the universality of death, and the power of the path of practice: that in the midst of this human world with all its sorrows, there is still a way to find that which is free from grieving, aging, and illness: the deathless.

            from fear of my mistresses’ beatings,
            harassed by their anger & words.
            But you, brahman,
            what do you fear
            that you’re always going down to the water
            with shivering limbs, feeling great cold?
            
              The Brahman:
              Puṇṇikā, surely you know.
              You’re asking one doing skillful kamma
              & warding off evil.
              Whoever, young or old, does evil kamma
              is, through water ablution,
              from evil kamma set free.
            
            
              Puṇṇikā:
              Who taught you this
              —the ignorant to the ignorant—
              ‘One, through water ablution,
              is from evil kamma set free’?
              In that case, they’d all go to heaven:
              all the frogs, turtles,
              serpents,1 crocodiles,
              & anything else that lives in the water.
              Sheep-butchers, pork-butchers,
              fishermen, trappers,
              thieves, executioners,
              & any other evil doers,
              would, through water ablution,
              be from evil kamma set free.
            
            
              If these rivers could carry off
              the evil kamma you’ve done in the past,
              they’d carry off your merit as well,
              and then you’d be
              completely deprived.
              Whatever it is that you fear,
              that you’re always going down to the water,
              don’t do it.
              Don’t let the cold hurt your skin.”
            
            
              The Brahman:
              I’ve been following the miserable path, good lady,
              and now you’ve brought me
              back to the noble.
              I give you this robe for water-ablution.
            
            
              Puṇṇikā:
              Let the robe be yours. I don’t need it.
              If you’re afraid of pain,
              if you dislike pain,
              then don’t do any evil kamma,
              in open, in secret.
              But if you do or will do
              any evil kamma,
              you’ll gain no freedom from pain,
              even if you fly up & hurry away.
              If you’re afraid of pain,
              if you dislike pain,
              go to the Awakened One for refuge,
              go to the Dhamma & Saṅgha.
              Take on the precepts:
              That will lead to your liberation.2
            
            
              The Brahman:
              I go to the Awakened One for refuge;
              I go to the Dhamma & Saṅgha.
              I take on the precepts:

            Rohiṇī’s father:
            You go to sleep saying,
            “Contemplatives.”
            You wake up,
            “Contemplatives.”
            You praise only
            contemplatives.
            No doubt you will be
            a contemplative.
            
              Abundant food & drink
              you give to contemplatives.
              Now, Rohiṇī, I ask you:
              Why do you hold
              contemplatives dear?
            
            
              They don’t like to work,
              they’re lazy,
              living off what’s given by others,
              full of hankerings,
              wanting delicious things:

              Rohiṇī:
              For a long time, father,
              you’ve quizzed me
              about contemplatives.
              I’ll praise to you
              their
              discernment,
              virtue,
              endeavor.
            
            
              They do like to work,
              they’re not lazy.
              They do the best work:
              They abandon
              passion & anger.
              That’s why I hold
              contemplatives dear.
            
            
              They rid themselves
              of the three evil roots,1
              doing pure actions.

              they go!
              That’s why I hold
              contemplatives dear.
            
            
              They don’t store in a granary,
              pot,
              or basket.
              They hunt [only]

              nor gold,
              nor money.
              They live off whatever is present:
              That’s why I hold

              Rohiṇī, truly for our benefit
              were you born in our family.
              You have conviction

Thig 13:5  Subhā the Goldsmith’s Daughter,Thig 13:5,https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Thig/thig13_5.html,"Thig 13:5  Subhā the Goldsmith’s Daughter  —  When her relatives try to tempt her to marry, Subhā tells them of the dangers of sensuality, then ordains and gains awakening.","KN/Thig/13:5
          
            “I was a child, with clean clothes,
            when I first heard the Dhamma.
            And within me, heedful,
            was a break-through to the truth.
            Then I arrived
            at an enormous dissatisfaction
            with all sensuality.
            Seeing the danger
            in self-identity,
            I longed only
            for renunciation.
            Leaving my circle of relatives,
            slaves, workers,
            prosperous villages & fields,
            delightful, enticing possessions,
            I went forth,
            abandoning not-insignificant wealth.
            
              Having gone out through conviction
              in the well-taught true Dhamma,
              it wouldn’t be proper for me—
              aspiring to nothingness—
              having cast off gold & silver
              to take them back.
              Gold & silver
              don’t buy awakening,
              don’t buy peace.
              This [gold] isn’t proper for contemplatives.
              This isn’t noble wealth.
              This is
              greediness, intoxication,
              delusion, bondage to dust,
              suspicion, many troubles.
              There’s no lasting stability here.
              It’s to this extent that many, many men
              —heedless, their hearts defiled—
              opposing one another, create
              conflicts, murder, bondage,
              calamity, loss, grief, & lamentation.
              Many misfortunes are seen
              for those head-over-heels in sensuality.
              So, my relatives:
              Why do you, like enemies,
              try to bind me to sensuality?
              You know I’ve gone forth,
              seeing the danger in sensuality.
              Gold coin & bullion
              can’t put an end to effluents.
              Sensuality is an enemy,
              a murderer,
              hostile, arrows & bonds.
              So, my relatives:
              Why do you, like enemies,
              try to bind me to sensuality?
              You know I’ve gone forth
              with shaven head, wrapped in a patchwork cloak.
              Leftover alms-scraps, gleanings,
              a robe made from cast-off cloth:
              That’s what’s proper for me—
              the requisites of one with no home.
              The great seers have rejected sensuality,
              both human & divine.
              Released are they,
              in the place of security.
              Arrived are they,
              in unshaken ease.
            
            
              So may I not come into union
              with sensuality, in which no shelter is found.
              It’s an enemy, a murderer
              —sensuality—
              painful, like a mass of flame.
              Greed:
              an obstacle,1 fearful, threatened,
              full of thorns,
              very discordant,
              a great cause of delusion.
              Sensuality:
              a frightening attack,
              like a snake’s head
              in which fools delight—
              blinded, run-of-the-mill.
            
            
              Because many people in the world
              are stuck in the mud of sensuality,
              unknowing,
              they don’t realize the ending of birth & death.
              Many people follow the path
              to bad destinations
              because of sensuality,
              bringing disease on themselves.
            
            
              Thus sensuality creates enemies.
              It burns, is defiled.
              It’s the bait of the world,
              constraining, the bondage of death,
              maddening, deceptive, agitating the mind.
              It’s a net cast by Māra
              for the defilement of living beings:
              with endless drawbacks, much pain,
              great poison,
              giving little enjoyment, creating conflict,
              drying up the good side [of the mind].
            
            
              I, having cast off2 much trouble like this
              caused by sensuality,
              will not return to it,
              as I always delight in unbinding.
              Doing battle with sensuality
              in hopes of the cool state,
              I will stay heedful, finding delight3
              in the ending of fetters.
              I follow the path—
              eightfold, straight,
              griefless, stainless, secure—
              over which great seers
              have crossed.”

          As Subhā the nun was going through Jīvaka’s delightful mango grove, a libertine (a goldsmith’s son) blocked her path, so she said to him:
          
            ‘What wrong have I done you
            that you stand in my way?
            It’s not proper, my friend,
            that a man should touch
            a woman gone forth.
            I respect the Master’s message,
            the training pointed out by the One Well-Gone.
            I am pure, without blemish:
            Why do you stand in my way?
            You—your mind agitated, impassioned;
            I—unagitated, unimpassioned,
            with a mind entirely freed:
            Why do you stand in my way?’
            
              ‘You are young & not bad-looking,
              what need do you have for going forth?
              Throw off your ochre robe—
              Come, let’s delight in the flowering grove.
              A sweetness they exude everywhere,
              the trees risen-up with their pollen.
              The beginning of spring is a pleasant season—
              Come, let’s delight in the flowering grove.
              The trees with their blossoming tips
              moan, as it were, in the breeze:
              What delight will you have
              if you plunge into the grove alone?
              Frequented by herds of wild beasts,
              disturbed by elephants rutting & aroused:
              You want to go
              unaccompanied
              into the great, lonely, frightening grove?
            
            
              Like a doll made of gold, you will go about,
              like a goddess in the gardens of heaven.
              With delicate, smooth Kāsī fabrics,
              you will shine, O beauty without compare.
              I would gladly do your every bidding
              if we were to dwell in the glade.
              For there is no creature dearer to me
              than you, O nymph with the languid regard.
              If you do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.
              Dwelling in the calm of a palace,
              have women wait on you,
              wear delicate Kāsī fabrics,
              adorn yourself with garlands & creams.
              I will make you many & varied ornaments
              of gold, jewels, & pearls.
              Climb onto a costly bed,
              scented with sandalwood carvings,
              with a well-washed coverlet, beautiful,
              spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.
            
            
              Like a blue lotus rising from the water
              where no human beings dwell,
              you will go to old age with your limbs unseen,
              if you stay as you are in the holy life.’
            
            
              ‘What do you assume of any essence,
              here in this cemetery grower, filled with corpses,
              this body destined to break up?
              What do you see when you look at me,
              you who are out of your mind?’
            
            
              ‘Your eyes are like those of a fawn,
              like those of a sprite in the mountains.
              Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight
              grows all the more.
              Like tips they are, of blue lotuses,
              in your golden face
              —spotless:
              Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight
              grows all the more.
              Even if you should go far away,
              I will think only of your pure,
              long-lashed gaze,
              for there is nothing dearer to me
              than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.’
            
            
              ‘You want to stray from the road,
              you want the moon as a plaything,
              you want to jump over Mount Sineru,
              you who have designs on one born of the Buddha.
              For there is nothing anywhere at all
              in the cosmos with its devas,
              that would be an object of passion for me.
              I don’t even know what that passion would be,
              for it’s been killed, root & all, by the path.
              Like embers from a pit—scattered,
              like a bowl of poison—evaporated,
              I don’t even see what that passion would be,
              for it’s been killed, root & all, by the path.
              Try to seduce one who hasn’t reflected on this,
              or who has not followed the Master’s teaching.
              But try it with this one who knows
              and you suffer.
              For in the midst of praise & blame,
              pleasure & pain,
              my mindfulness stands firm.
              Knowing the unattractiveness
              of things compounded,
              my mind cleaves to nothing at all.
              I am a follower of the One Well-Gone,
              riding the vehicle of the eightfold way:
              My arrow removed, effluent-free,
              I delight, having gone to an empty dwelling.
              For I have seen well-painted puppets,
              hitched up with sticks & strings,
              made to dance in various ways.
              When the sticks & strings are removed,
              thrown away, scattered, shredded,
              smashed into pieces, not to be found,
              in what will the mind there make its home?
              This body of mine, which is just like that,
              when devoid of dhammas doesn’t function.
              When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn’t function,
              in what will the mind there make its home?
            
            
              Like a mural you’ve seen, painted on a wall,
              smeared with yellow orpiment,
              there your vision has been distorted,
              your perception1 of a human being—pointless.
              Like an evaporated mirage,
              like a tree of gold in a dream,
              like a magic show in the midst of a crowd—
              you run blind after what is unreal.
              Resembling a ball of sealing wax,
              set in a hollow,
              with a bubble in the middle
              and bathed with tears,
              eye secretions are born there too:
              The parts of the eye
              are rolled all together
              in various ways.’
            
            
              Plucking out her lovely eye,
              with mind unattached
              she felt no regret.
            
            
              ‘Here, take this eye. It’s yours.’
            
            
              Straightaway she gave it to him.
              Straightaway his passion faded right there,
              and he begged her forgiveness:
            
            
              ‘Be well, follower of the holy life.
              This sort of thing
              won’t happen again.
              Harming a person like you
              is like embracing a blazing fire.
              It’s as if I have seized a poisonous snake.
              So may you be well. Forgive me.’
            
            
              And released from there, the nun
              went to the excellent Buddha’s presence.
              When she saw the mark of his excellent merit,
              her eye became
              as it was before.",No Introduction,"1. Reading saññā with the Burmese and Sinhalese editions. The Thai and PTS editions read paññā, “discernment.”",: SN 5:5; AN 4:184; AN 5:75–76; Thag 16:1
