                Phenomena are
                preceded by the heart,
                ruled by the heart,
                made of the heart.
                If you speak or act
                with a corrupted heart,
                then suffering follows you –
                as the wheel of the cart,
                the track of the ox
                that pulls it.
              
              
                Phenomena are

                ruled by the heart,
                made of the heart.
                If you speak or act
                with a calm, bright heart,
                then happiness follows you,
                like a shadow
                that never leaves.

                ‘He       insulted me,
                hit me,
                beat me,
                robbed me’
                –for those who brood on this,
                hostility isn’t stilled.
              
              
                ‘He insulted me,
                hit me,

                for those who don’t brood on this,
                hostility is stilled.
              
              
                Hostilities aren’t stilled
                through hostility,
                regardless.
                Hostilities are stilled
                through non-hostility:
                this, an unending truth.
              
              
                Unlike those who don’t realize
                that we’re here on the verge
                of perishing,
                those who do:
                their quarrels are stilled.

                One who stays focused on the beautiful,
                is unrestrained with the senses,
                knowing no moderation in food,
                apathetic, unenergetic:
                Mara overcomes him
                as the wind, a weak tree.
              
              
                One who stays focused on the foul,
                is restrained with regard to the senses,
                knowing moderation in food,
                full of conviction & energy:
                Mara does not overcome him
                as the wind, a mountain of rock.

                He who,

                devoid
                of truthfulness
                & self-control,
                puts on the ochre robe,
                doesn’t deserve the ochre robe.
              
              
                But he who is free
                of depravity

                & self-control,
                well-established
                in the precepts,

                Those who regard

                don’t get to the essence,
                ranging about in wrong resolves.
              
              
                But those who know

                the undeveloped mind.
              
              
                As rain doesn’t seep into

                In both worlds

                He grieves, he’s afflicted,
                seeing the corruption
                of his deeds.

                He rejoices, is jubilant,
                seeing the purity
                of his deeds.

                In both worlds
                the wrong-doer’s tormented.
                He’s tormented at the thought,
                ‘I’ve done wrong.’
                Having gone to a bad destination,
                he’s tormented

                Here

                In both worlds
                the merit-maker delights.
                He delights at the thought,

                If he recites many teachings, but
                –heedless man–
                doesn’t do what they say,
                like a cowherd counting the cattle of
                others,
                he has no share in the contemplative life.
              
              
                If he recites next to nothing
                but follows the Dhamma
                in line with the Dhamma;
                abandoning passion,
                aversion, delusion;
                alert,
                his mind well released,
                not clinging
                either here or hereafter:
                he has his share in the contemplative life.

                Heedfulness:
                the path to the Deathless.
                Heedlessness:
                the path to death.
                The heedful do not die.
                The heedless are as if
                already dead.
              
              
                Knowing this as a true distinction,
                those wise
                in heedfulness
                rejoice
                in heedfulness,
                enjoying the range of the noble ones.
              
              
                The enlightened, constantly
                absorbed in jhana,
                persevering,
                firm in their effort:
                they touch Unbinding,
                the unexcelled rest
                from the yoke.
              
              
                Those with initiative,
                mindful,
                clean in action,
                acting with due consideration,
                heedful, restrained,
                living the Dhamma:

              21-24*
              
                Through initiative, heedfulness,
                restraint, & self-control,
                the wise would make
                an island
                no flood
                can submerge.

                They’re addicted to heedlessness
                –dullards, fools–
                while one who is wise
                cherishes heedfulness
                as his highest wealth.
              
              26
              
                Don’t give way to heedlessness
                or to intimacy
                with sensual delight–
                for a heedful person,

                heedlessness
                with heedfulness,
                having climbed the high tower
                of discernment,

                just as a fast horse advances,
                leaving the weak behind:
                so the wise.

                to lordship over the devas.

                does go against the wind.
                The person of integrity

                Next to nothing, this scent
                –sandalwood, tagara–
                while the scent of virtuous conduct
                wafts to the devas,
                supreme.

                How wealth?

                A fool with a sense of his foolishness
                is–at least to that extent–wise.
                But a fool who thinks himself wise
                really deserves to be called
                a fool.

                as the ladle,
                the taste of the soup.

                But when that evil ripens,
                the fool falls into
                pain.
              
              69
              
                Month after month

                only a tip-of-grass measure of food,
                but he wouldn’t be worth
                one sixteenth

                the Dhamma.

                An evil deed, when done,

                come out right away.
                It follows the fool,
                smoldering
                like a fire
                hidden in ashes.

                Only for his ruin
                does renown come to the fool.
                It ravages his bright fortune
                & rips his head      apart.
              
              
                He would want unwarranted status,
                preeminence among monks,
                authority
                among monasteries,
                homage
                from lay families.
              
              
                ‘Let householders & those gone forth
                both think that this

                May I alone determine
                what’s a duty, what’s not’:
                the resolve of a fool
                as they grow–
                his desire & pride.

                goes one way,
                the way to Unbinding,
                another.
                Realizing this, the monk,
                a disciple to the Awakened One,
                should not relish offerings,

                who reach the Far Shore.
                These others
                simply scurry along

                in seclusion, so hard to enjoy.
              
              
                There he should wish for delight,
                discarding sensuality–
                he who has nothing.
                He should cleanse himself–wise–
                of what defiles the mind.
              
              
                Whose minds are well-developed
                in the factors for self-awakening,
                who delight in non-clinging,
                relinquishing grasping–
                resplendent,
                their effluents ended:
                they, in the world,
                are Unbound.

                harsh pains, devastation, a broken body, grave illness, mental derangement, trouble with the government, violent slander, relatives lost, property dissolved, houses burned down.
              
              
                At the break-up of the body
                this one with no discernment,

                ‘Stressful,

                people threatened with danger.
                That’s not the secure refuge,

                to the Buddha, Dhamma,
                & Sangha for refuge,
                you see with right discernment
                the four noble truths–
                stress,
                the cause of stress,
                the transcending of stress,

                It’s simply not true
                that he’s born everywhere.

                –Awakened Ones or their disciples–
                who’ve transcended
                objectification,
                crossed over
                lamentation
                & grief,
                who are unendangered,
                fearless,
                unbound:
                there’s no measure for reckoning
                that your merit’s ‘this much.’

                you have no attachment
                –have nothing at all–
                no sufferings, no stresses, invade.
              
              221
              
                When anger arises,
                whoever keeps firm control
                as if with a racing chariot:
                him
                I call a master charioteer.
                Anyone else,
                a rein-holder–
                that’s all.
              
              222
              
                Conquer anger
                with lack of anger;
                bad with good;
                stinginess with a gift;
                a liar with truth.
              
              223
              
                By telling the truth;
                by not growing angry;
                by giving, when asked,
                no matter how little you have:
                by these three things
                you enter the presence of devas.
              
              224
              
                Gentle sages,
                constantly restrained in body,
                go to the unwavering state
                where, having gone,
                there’s no grief.
              
              225
              
                Those who always stay wakeful,
                training by day & by night,
                keen on Unbinding:
                their effluents come to an end.
              
              226
              
                This has come down from old, Atula,
                & not just from today:
                they find fault with one
                who sits silent,
                they find fault with one
                who speaks a great deal,
                they find fault with one
                who measures his words.
                There’s no one unfaulted in the world.
              
              
                There never was,
                will be,
                nor at present is found
                anyone entirely faulted
                or entirely praised.
              
              227-228
              
                If knowledgeable people praise him,
                having observed him
                day after day
                to be blameless in conduct, intelligent,
                endowed with discernment & virtue:
                like an ingot of gold–
                who’s fit to find fault with him?
                Even devas praise him.
                Even by Brahma he’s praised.
              
              229-230
              
                Guard against anger
                erupting in body;
                in body, be restrained.
                Having abandoned bodily misconduct,
                live conducting yourself well
                in body.
              
              
                Guard against anger
                erupting in speech;
                in speech, be restrained.
                Having abandoned verbal misconduct,
                live conducting yourself well
                in speech.
              
              
                Guard against anger
                erupting in mind;
                in mind, be restrained.
                Having abandoned mental misconduct,
                live conducting yourself well
                in mind.
              
              
                Those restrained in body
                –the enlightened–
                restrained in speech & in mind
                –enlightened–
                are the ones whose restraint is secure.

                You are now
                like a yellowed leaf.
                Already
                Yama’s minions stand near.
                You stand at the door to departure
                but have yet to provide
                for the journey.
              
              
                Make an island for yourself!
                Work quickly! Be wise!
                With impurities all blown away,
                unblemished,
                you’ll reach the divine realm
                of the noble ones.
              
              
                You are now
                right at the end of your time.
                You are headed
                to Yama’s presence,
                with no place to rest along the way,
                but have yet to provide
                for the journey.

                With impurities all blown away,
                unblemished,
                you won’t again undergo birth
                & aging.
              
              235-238*
              
                Just as a silver smith
                step by
                step,
                bit by
                bit,
                moment to
                moment,
                blows away the impurities
                of molten silver–
                so the wise man, his own.
              
              239
              
                Just as rust
                –iron’s impurity–
                eats the very iron
                from which it is born,
                so the deeds
                of one who lives slovenly
                lead him on
                to a bad destination.
              
              240*
              
                No recitation: the ruinous impurity
                of chants.
                No initiative: of a household.
                Indolence: of beauty.
                Heedlessness: of a guard.
              
              
                In a woman, misconduct is an impurity.
                In a donor, stinginess.
                Evil deeds are the real impurities
                in this world & the next.
              
              
                More impure than these impurities
                is the ultimate impurity:
                ignorance.
                Having abandoned this impurity,
                monks, you’re impurity-free.
              
              241-243
              
                Life’s easy to live
                for someone unscrupulous,
                cunning as a crow,
                corrupt, back-biting,
                forward, & brash;
                but for someone who’s constantly
                scrupulous, cautious,
                observant, sincere,
                pure in his livelihood,
                clean in his pursuits,
                it’s hard.
              
              244-245
              
                Whoever kills, lies, steals,
                goes to someone else’s wife,
                & is addicted to intoxicants,
                digs himself up
                by the root
                right here in this world.
              
              
                So know, my good man,
                that bad deeds are reckless.
                Don’t let greed & unrighteousness
                oppress you with long-term pain.

                People give
                in line with their faith,
                in line with conviction.
                Whoever gets flustered
                at food & drink given to others,
                attains no concentration
                by day or by night.
              
              
                But one in whom this is
                cut through
                up-rooted
                wiped out–
                attains concentration

                no river like craving.
              
              251
              
                It’s easy to see
                the errors of others,
                but hard to see
                your own.
                You winnow like chaff
                the errors of others,
                but conceal your own–
                like a cheat, an unlucky throw.
              
              
                If you focus on the errors of others,
                constantly finding fault,
                your effluents flourish.
                You’re far from their ending.
              
              252-253
              
                There’s no trail in space,
                no outside contemplative.
                People are smitten
                with objectification,
                but devoid of objectification are
                the Tathagatas.
              
              
                There’s no trail in space,
                no outside contemplative,
                no eternal fabrications,
                no wavering in the Awakened.

                To pass judgment hurriedly
                doesn’t mean you’re a judge.
                The wise one, weighing both
                the right judgment & wrong,
                judges others impartially–
                unhurriedly, in line with the Dhamma,
                guarding the Dhamma,
                guarded by Dhamma,
                intelligent:
                he’s called a judge.

                Simply talking a lot
                doesn’t mean one is wise.
                Whoever’s secure–
                no
                hostility,
                fear–
                is said to be wise.
              
              
                Simply talking a lot
                doesn’t maintain the Dhamma.
                Whoever
                –although he’s heard next to nothing–
                sees Dhamma through his body,
                is not heedless of Dhamma:
                he’s one who maintains the Dhamma.

                A head of gray hairs
                doesn’t mean one’s an elder.
                Advanced in years,
                one’s called an old fool.
              
              
                But one in whom there is
                truth, restraint,
                rectitude, gentleness,
                self-control–

                enlightened.
              
              260-261
              
                Not by suave conversation
                or lotus-like coloring
                does an envious, miserly cheat
                become an exemplary man.
              
              
                But one in whom this is

                he’s called exemplary,
                his aversion disgorged,
                intelligent.
              
              262-263
              
                A shaven head
                doesn’t mean a contemplative.
                The liar observing no duties,
                filled with greed & desire:
                what kind of contemplative’s he?
              
              
                But whoever tunes out
                the dissonance
                of his evil qualities
                –large or small–
                in every way
                by bringing evil to consonance:
                he’s called a contemplative.
              
              264-265*
              
                Begging from others
                doesn’t mean one’s a monk.
                As long as one follows
                householders’ ways,
                one is no monk at all.
              
              
                But whoever puts aside
                both merit & evil and,
                living the chaste life,
                judiciously
                goes through the world:
                he’s called a monk.
              
              266-267
              
                Not by silence
                does someone confused
                & unknowing
                turn into a sage.
              
              
                But whoever–wise,
                as if holding the scales,
                taking the excellent–
                rejects evil deeds:
                he is a sage,

                this force of reasoning,
                the wise man, restrained by virtue,
                should make the path pure

                kicks up all the more dust.
              
              
                It’s better to leave a misdeed
                undone.
                A misdeed burns you afterward.
                Better that a good deed be done
                that, after you’ve done it,
                won’t make you burn.
              
              311-314
              
                Like a frontier fortress,
                guarded inside & out,
                guard yourself.
                Don’t let the moment pass by.
                Those for whom the moment is past
                grieve, consigned to hell.
              
              315
              
                Ashamed of what’s not shameful,
                not ashamed of what is,
                beings adopting wrong views
                go to a bad destination.
              
              
                Seeing danger where there is none,
                & no danger where there is,
                beings adopting wrong views
                go to a bad destination.
              
              
                Imagining error where there is none,
                and no error where there is,
                beings adopting wrong views
                go to a bad destination.
              
              
                But knowing error as error,
                and non-error as non-,
                beings adopting right views
                go to a good
                destination.

                I–like an elephant in battle,
                enduring an arrow shot from a bow–
                will endure a false accusation,
                for the mass of people
                have no         principles.

                The tamed is the one
                they take into assemblies.
                The tamed is the one
                the king mounts.
                The tamed who endures
                a false accusation
                is, among human beings,
                the best.
              
              321
              
                Excellent are tamed mules,
                tamed thoroughbreds,
                tamed horses from Sindh.
                Excellent, tamed tuskers,
                great elephants.
                But even more excellent
                are those         self-tamed.
              
              
                For not by these mounts could you go
                to the land unreached,
                as the tamed one goes
                by taming, well-taming, himself.
              
              322-323
              
                The tusker, Dhanapalaka,
                deep in rut, is hard to control.
                Bound, he won’t eat a morsel:
                the tusker misses
                the elephant wood.
              
              324*
              
                When torpid & over-fed,
                a sleepy-head lolling about
                like a stout hog, fattened on fodder:
                a dullard enters the womb
                over &
                over again.
              
              325
              
                Before, this mind went wandering
                however it pleased,
                wherever it wanted,
                by whatever way that it liked.
                Today I will hold it aptly in check–
                as one wielding a goad, an elephant in rut.
              
              326
              
                Delight in heedfulness.
                Watch over your own mind.
                Lift yourself up
                from the hard-going way,
                like a tusker sunk in the mud.

                a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened–
                overcoming all dangers
                go with him, gratified,

                If you don’t gain a mature companion–
                a fellow traveler, right-living, enlightened–
                go alone
                like a king renouncing his kingdom,
                like the elephant in the Matanga wilds,
                his herd.
              
              
                Going alone is better.
                There’s no companionship with a fool.
                Go alone,
                doing no evil, at peace,

              Dhp XXIV : CravingNavigationSuttas/KN/Dhp/24
              
                When a person lives heedlessly,
                his craving grows like a creeping vine.
                He runs now here
                & now         there,
                as if looking for fruit:
                a monkey in the forest.
              
              334
              
                If this sticky, uncouth craving
                overcomes you in the world,
                your sorrows grow like wild grass
                after rain.
              
              
                If, in the world, you overcome
                this uncouth craving, hard to escape,
                sorrows roll off you,
                like water beads off
                a lotus.
              
              335-336
              
                To all of you gathered here
                I say: Good fortune.
                Dig up craving
                –as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass–
                by the root.
                Don’t let Mara cut you down
                –as a raging river, a reed–
                over & over again.
              
              337*
              
                If its root remains
                undamaged & strong,
                a tree, even if cut,
                will grow back.
                So too if craving-obsession
                is not rooted out,
                this suffering returns
                again
                &
                again.
              
              338
              
                He whose 36 streams,
                flowing to what is appealing, are strong:
                the currents–resolves based on passion–
                carry him, of base views, away.
              
              
                They flow every which way, the streams,
                but the sprouted creeper stays
                in place.
                Now, seeing that the creeper’s arisen,
                cut through its root
                with discernment.
              
              339-340*
              
                Loosened & oiled
                are the joys of a person.
                People, bound by enticement,
                looking for ease:
                to birth & aging they go.
              
              341*
              
                Encircled with craving,
                people hop round & around
                like a rabbit caught in a snare.
                Tied with fetters & bonds
                they go on to suffering,
                again & again, for long.
              
              
                Encircled with craving,
                people hop round & around
                like a rabbit caught in a snare.
                So a monk
                should dispel      craving,
                should aspire      to dispassion
                for himself.
              
              342-343*
              
                Cleared of the underbrush
                but obsessed with the forest,
                set free from the forest,
                right back to the forest he runs.
                Come, see the person set free
                who runs right back to the same old chains!
              
              344
              
                That’s not a strong bond
                –so say the enlightened–
                the one made of iron, of wood, or of grass.
                To be smitten, enthralled,
                with jewels & ornaments,
                longing for children & wives:
                that’s the strong bond,
                –so say the enlightened–
                one that’s constraining,
                elastic,
                hard to untie.
              
              
                But having cut it, they
                –the enlightened–go forth,
                free of longing, abandoning
                sensual ease.
              
              
                Those smitten with passion
                fall back
                into a self-made stream,
                like a spider snared in its web.
                But, having cut it, the enlightened set forth,
                free of longing, abandoning
                all suffering & stress.
              
              345-347*
              
                Gone to the beyond of becoming,
                you let go of in front,
                let go of behind,
                let go of between.
                With a heart everywhere released,
                you don’t come again to birth
                & aging.
              
              348*
              
                For a person
                forced on by his thinking,
                fierce in his passion,
                focused on beauty,
                craving grows all the more.
                He’s the one
                who tightens the bond.
              
              
                But one who delights
                in the stilling of thinking,
                always
                mindful
                cultivating
                a focus on the foul:
                He’s the one
                who will make an end,
                the one who will cut Mara’s bond.
              
              349-350*
              
                Arrived at the finish,
                unfrightened, unblemished, free
                of craving, he has cut away
                the arrows of becoming.
                This physical heap is his last.
              
              
                Free from craving,
                ungrasping,
                astute in expression,
                knowing the combination of sounds–
                which comes first & which after.
                He’s called a
                last-body
                greatly discerning
                great man.

                unadhering.
                All-abandoning,
                released in the ending of craving:
                having fully known on my own,
                to whom should I point as my teacher?
              
              353*
              
                A gift of Dhamma conquers
                all gifts;
                the taste of Dhamma,
                all tastes;
                a delight in Dhamma,
                all delights;
                the ending of craving,
                all suffering
                & stress.

                Riches ruin the man
                weak in discernment,
                but not those who seek
                the beyond.
                Through craving for riches
                the man weak in discernment
                ruins   himself

                free of passion
                bears great fruit.

                Restraint with the eye is good,
                good is restraint with the ear.
                Restraint with the nose is good,
                good is restraint with the tongue.
                Restraint with the body is good,
                good is restraint with speech.
                Restraint with the heart is good,
                good is restraint everywhere.
                A monk everywhere restrained
                is released from all suffering & stress.
              
              360-361*
              
                Hands restrained,
                feet restrained
                speech restrained,
                supremely restrained–
                delighting in what is inward,
                content, centered, alone:
                he’s what they call
                a monk.
              
              362
              
                A monk restrained in his speaking,
                giving counsel unruffled,
                declaring the message & meaning:
                sweet is his speech.
              
              363*
              
                Dhamma his dwelling,
                Dhamma his delight,
                a monk pondering Dhamma,
                calling Dhamma to mind,
                does not fall away
                from true Dhamma.

                Gains:
                don’t treat your own with scorn,
                don’t go coveting those of others.
                A monk who covets those of others
                attains
                no concentration.
              
              
                Even if he gets next to nothing,
                he doesn’t treat his gains with scorn.
                Living purely, untiring:
                he’s the one
                that the devas praise.

                & who doesn’t grieve
                for what’s not:
                he’s deservedly called
                a monk.
              
              367
              
                Dwelling in goodwill, a monk
                with faith in the Awakened One’s teaching,
                would attain the good state,
                the peaceful state:
                stilling-of-fabrications ease.
              
              368*
              
                Monk, bail out this boat.
                It will take you lightly when bailed.
                Having cut through passion, aversion,
                you go from there to Unbinding.
              
              369*
              
                Cut through five,
                let go of five,
                & develop five above all.
                A monk gone past five attachments
                is said to have crossed the flood.
              
              370*
              
                Practice jhana, monk,
                and don’t be heedless.
                Don’t take your mind roaming
                in sensual strands.
                Don’t swallow–heedless–
                the ball of iron aflame.
                Don’t burn & complain: ‘This is pain.’

                no jhana
                for one with
                no discernment,
                no discernment
                for one with
                no jhana.
                But one with
                both jhana
                & discernment:
                he’s on the verge
                of Unbinding.
              
              372
              
                A monk with his mind at peace,
                going into an empty dwelling,
                clearly seeing the Dhamma aright:
                his delight is more
                than human.
              
              
                However it is,
                however it is he touches
                the arising-&-passing of aggregates:
                he gains rapture & joy:
                that, for those who know it,
                is deathless,
                the Deathless.
              
              373-374
              
                Here the first things
                for a discerning monk
                are
                guarding the senses,
                contentment,
                restraint in line with the Patimokkha.
                He should associate with admirable friends.
              
              
                Living purely, untiring,
                hospitable by habit,
                skilled in his conduct,
                gaining a manifold joy,
                he will put an end
                to suffering & stress.
              
              375-376
              
                Shed passion
                & aversion, monks–
                as a jasmine would,
                its withered flowers.
              
              377
              
                Calmed in body,
                calmed in speech,
                well-centered & calm,
                having disgorged the baits of the world,
                a monk is called
                thoroughly
                calmed.
              
              378
              
                You yourself
                should reprove yourself,
                should examine yourself.
                As a self-guarded monk
                with guarded self,
                mindful, you dwell at ease.

                Your own self is
                your own mainstay.
                Your own self is
                your own guide.
                Therefore you should
                watch over yourself–
                as a trader, a fine steed.

                One should not strike a brahman,

                Shame on a brahman’s killer.

                He’s called a ‘bho-sayer’

                But someone with nothing,
                who clings to no thing:

                Beyond attachment,
                unshackled:

              398*
              
                He endures–unangered–
                insult, assault, & imprisonment.
                His army is strength;
                his strength, forbearance:

              400*
              
                Like water   on a lotus leaf,
                a mustard seed   on the tip of an awl,
                he doesn’t adhere   to sensual pleasures:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              401
              
                He discerns right here,
                for himself,
                on his own,
                his own
                ending of stress.
                Unshackled, his burden laid down:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              402*
              
                Wise, profound
                in discernment, astute
                as to what is the path
                & what’s not;
                his ultimate goal attained:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              403
              
                Uncontaminated
                by householders
                & houseless ones alike;
                living with no home,
                with next to no wants:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              404
              
                Having put aside violence
                against beings fearful or firm,
                he neither kills nor
                gets others to kill:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              405
              
                Unopposing among opposition,
                unbound
                among the armed,
                unclinging
                among those who cling:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              406
              
                His passion, aversion,
                conceit, & contempt,
                have fallen away–
                like a mustard seed
                from the tip of an awl:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              407
              
                He would say
                what’s	non-grating,
                instructive,
                true–
                abusing no one:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              408
              
                Here in the world
                he takes nothing not-given
                –long, short,
                large, small,
                attractive, not:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              409
              
                His longing for this
                & for the next world
                can’t be found;
                free from longing, unshackled:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              410
              
                His attachments,
                his homes,
                can’t be found.
                He, through knowing,
                is unperplexed,
                has gained a footing
                in the Deathless:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              411*
              
                He has gone
                beyond attachment here
                for both merit & evil–
                sorrowless, dustless, & pure:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              412*
              
                Spotless, pure, like the moon
                –limpid & calm–
                his delights, his becomings,
                totally gone:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              413
              
                He has made his way past
                this hard-going path
                –samsara, delusion–
                has crossed over,
                has gone beyond,
                is free from want,
                from perplexity,
                absorbed in jhana,
                through no-clinging
                Unbound:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              414
              
                Whoever, abandoning sensual passions here,
                would go forth from home–
                his sensual passions, becomings,
                totally gone:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              
                Whoever, abandoning craving here,

              415-416
              
                Having left behind
                the human bond,
                having made his way past
                the divine,
                from all bonds unshackled:

                Having left behind
                delight & displeasure,
                cooled, with no acquisitions–
                a hero who has conquered

              418
              
                He knows in every way
                beings’ passing away,
                and their re-
                arising;
                unattached, awakened,
                well-gone:

              419
              
                He whose course they don’t know
                –devas, gandhabbas, & human beings–
                his effluents ended, an arahant:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              420
              
                He who has nothing
                –in front, behind, in between–
                the one with nothing
                who clings to no thing:
                he’s what I call
                a brahman.
              
              421*
              
                A splendid bull, conqueror,
                hero, great seer–
                free from want,
                awakened, washed:

              422
              
                He knows
                his former lives.
                He sees
                heavens & states of woe,
