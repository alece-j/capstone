              1. The right exertions are the four aspects of right effort; the establishings of mindfulness, the four aspects of right mindfulness. See SN 45:8. On the image of the establishings of mindfulness as a monk’s proper range, see SN 47:6–7.
              2. Formally, this verse is noteworthy in that each of the first three lines is composed of a single long compound. This style, which became common in later Indian literature because it was considered to convey strength, is uncommonly “strong” for a verse in the Pali Canon. For a similar example, see Dhp 39.
              “Effluent” here is a translation of the term āsava, which stands for three tendencies that “flow out” of the mind and lead to the flood of rebirth: sensuality, becoming, and ignorance. The Jains, contemporaries of the Buddha, also used the term “effluent” in their teachings, but the Buddhist use of the term differed from theirs in two important respects. First, for the Buddhists, effluents were mental, whereas for the Jains they were physical: sticky substances that kept what they regarded as the soul attached to the process of transmigration. Second, for the Jains a living person could become freed of the effluents only at his/her final death. Thus a living person could not be effluent-free. For the Buddhists, however, one became effluent-free at the point of total awakening. Thus a living arahant was effluent-free. Many of the speakers in the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā speak of themselves as effluent-free—see, for instance,Thag 18, Thig 5:11, Thig 14—which means that they are employing the concept in its strictly Buddhist sense.

              Note
              1. Becoming (bhava) is a term to describe a sense of identity in a particular world of experience, which can develop on any of three levels: sensuality, form, or formlessness. Craving for becoming is one of the causes of stress and suffering; passion for becoming is one of the last fetters abandoned at full awakening. For more on the topic of becoming, see The Paradox of Becoming.

              1. This phrase can be taken in two ways: (a) consummate in that he has a pure lineage on both his mother’s and his father’s side; and (b) consummate in that he belongs both to a well-born lineage in the worldly sense and, by means of his meditative attainments, to the lineage of the noble ones. See AN 4:28.
              2. One with knowledge of past lives, knowledge of the passing away and rearising of living beings, and knowledge of the ending of mental effluents. See MN 4. This list is the Buddhist response to the brahmanical claim that a person should be a master of three knowledges. In the brahmanical case, a three-knowledge man knew the three Vedas. The Buddhists claimed that their three knowledges were superior in that they were not mere hearsay, they could be known by men and women of all castes (see Thig 13:5), and they could put an end to suffering.
              3. Māra.

              there in the cemetery.
              Though some were disgusted,
              seeing her—dead, evil—
              lust
              appeared,
              as if I were blind
              to the oozings.
              
                In less time than it takes
                for rice to cook,
                I got out of that place.
                Mindful, alert, I
                sat down to one side.
                Then apt attention arose in me,
                the drawbacks appeared,
                disenchantment stood
                at an even keel:
              
              
                With that, my heart was released.

          When a person lives heedlessly,
          his craving grows like a creeping vine.
          He runs now here
          & now      there,
          as if looking for fruit:
          a monkey in the forest.
          
          If this sticky, uncouth craving
          overcomes you in the world,
          your sorrows grow like wild grass
          after rain.
          
          
          If, in the world, you overcome
          this uncouth craving, hard to escape,
          sorrows roll off you,
          like water beads off
          a lotus.
          
          
          To all of you gathered here
          I say:
          Good fortune.
          Dig up craving
          —as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass—
          by the root.
          Don’t let Māra cut you down
          —as a raging river, a reed—
          over & over again.1
          
          
          Do what the Buddha says.
          Don’t let the moment pass by.
          Those for whom the moment is past
          grieve, consigned to hell.2
          Heedlessness is dust.
          Dust follows on heedlessness.
          Through heedfulness, knowledge,
          pull out

                —your own, the other’s—
                those who think you a fool
                know nothing of Dhamma.
              
              
                If anger arises,
                reflect on the saw simile.1
                If craving for savor,
                remember the son’s-flesh simile.2
              
              
                If your mind runs loose
                after sensual pleasures
                & states of becoming,
                quickly restrain it with mindfulness
                as you would a bad ox
                eating grain.3

              Rain soddens what’s covered
              & doesn’t sodden what’s exposed.
              So open up what’s covered up,
              so that it won’t get soddened by the rain.1
              
                Attacked by death
                is the world,
                surrounded by aging,
                beset by the arrow of craving,
                always obscured by desire.
              
              
                Attacked by death
                is the world,
                & encircled by aging,
                constantly beaten, with no shelter,
                like a thief
                sentenced to punishment.
              
              
                They encroach like masses of flame,
                these three:
                death, aging, & illness.
                There’s no strength to confront them,
                no speed to run away.
              
              
                Make the day not-in-vain,
                a little or a lot.
                However much
                the day passes,
                that’s how much less
                is life.
                Your last day approaches.
                This isn’t your time
                to be heedless.

              Ornamented, finely clothed,
              garlanded, adorned,
              her feet stained red with lac,
              she wore slippers:
              a courtesan.
              Stepping out of her slippers—
              her hands raised before me,
              palm-to-palm over her heart—
              she softly, tenderly,
              in measured words
              spoke to me first:
              “You are young, recluse.
              Heed my message:
              Partake of human sensuality.
              I will give you luxury.
              Truly I vow to you,
              I will tend to you as to a fire.
              When we are old,
              both leaning on canes,
              then we will both become recluses,
              winning the benefits of both worlds.”
              
                And seeing her before me—
                a courtesan, ornamented, finely clothed,
                hands palm-to-palm over her heart—
                like a snare of death laid out,
                apt attention arose in me,
                the drawbacks appeared,
                disenchantment stood
                at an even keel:
              
              
                With that, my heart was released.
              
              
                See the Dhamma’s true rightness!
                The three knowledges
                have been attained;

    Thag 10:1  KāludāyinNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/10:1
            This is a poem in at least two parts. In the first part, Ven. Kāludāyin is addressing the Buddha soon after the latter’s awakening, inviting him to return home to visit his family. In the second part, Kāludāyin is addressing the Buddha’s father, Suddhodana, at the time of the Buddha’s return, perhaps to make Suddhodana favorably inclined to receive his son.
            There is a question, though, as to where the first part ends and the second begins. The Commentary assigns only the last stanza—beginning with, “I am the son of the Buddha”—to the second part, and everything before that to the first. This, however, doesn’t fit with the fact that the seventh stanza is obviously addressed to the person who engendered the Buddha, and not to the Buddha himself. For this reason, I have placed the division into two parts after the sixth stanza, as the first six stanzas are unified by the theme of bearing fruit, with the fourth and fifth stanzas possibly included to remind the Buddha of the good results that would come to his family if he provided them with the opportunity to give him alms. Alternatively, the division could be placed after the fourth stanza, in that the fifth stanza could be interpreted as beginning a line of thought aimed at putting the listener into the proper mood to accept the principle of the results of good kamma seen not in this lifetime but in the next.
            
              Covered in embers now are the trees,
              shedding their canopy, lord, in search of fruit.
              As if flaring up, they glow.
              The time, great hero, partakes of savors.
              
                The trees in bloom, delightful,
                waft delights
                all around, in all directions,
                dropping their petals in hope of fruit.
                Now, O hero, is the time to set forth.
              
              
                Neither too cold nor too hot:
                pleasant the season, lord, fit for a journey.
                Let them see you—the Sakyans & Koliyans—
                facing west, crossing in the Rohiṇī.1
              
              
                In hope they plow the field.
                In hope the seed is sown.
                In hope do merchants go to sea,
                bringing back wealth.
                Let the hope in which I stand bear fruit.2
              
              
                Again & again      they sow the seed.3
                Again & again      the deva-kings rain.
                Again & again      farmers plow the fields.
                Again & again      grain comes to the kingdom.
              
              
                Again & again      beggars wander.
                Again & again      lords of giving give.
                Again & again      having given, the lords of giving
                again & again      go to the heavenly place.

                Truly, an enlightened4 one of deep discernment
                cleanses, back for seven generations,
                the family in which he’s born.
                I would imagine you to be Sakka,5 the deva of devas
                for you engendered a sage truly named.
              
              
                Suddhodana is the name of the Great Seer’s father,
                and Māyā name of the Buddha’s mother6
                who, having nurtured the bodhisatta with her womb,
                at the break-up of the body, rejoices in the threefold divine realm.7
              
              
                She, Gotamī, having passed away,
                having fallen away from here,
                is now endowed with heavenly sensual pleasures.
                She rejoices in the five strings of sensuality,
                surrounded by those groups of devas.
              
              
                I am the son of the Buddha,
                who endures what is hard to endure—
                Aṅgīrasa8: incomparable, Such.
                You, Sakka, are my father’s father.
                In the Dhamma, Gotama,
                you are my grandfather.
              
            
            
              Notes
              1. Rohiṇī is the name both of a river at the edge of the Sakyan lands and of an asterism, i.e., a star in the zodiac used to indicate a season of time.
              2. Reading vipaccatu with the Thai edition, which seems to fit better with the imagery in the earlier part of the poem than the reading in the other editions—samijjhatu, “may it succeed.”
              3. Reading kasate with the Thai edition.
              4. Reading dhīro with the Thai edition. The other editions read vīro, “hero.”
              5. Sakka is the name of the king of the devas of the heaven of the Thirty-three. Ven. Kāludāyin is playing here with the similarity between this name and that of the Sakyan lineage.
              6. Reading Māyanāmā with the Sri Lankan and PTS editions. The Thai edition reads Māyā mahesī, so that the line would read, “The Buddha’s mother is Queen Māyā.” This would provide a play on words—mahesi, great seer, and mahesī, queen—but there is nothing in the early suttas to indicate that Suddhodana was a king, or Māyā a queen.
              7. The Commentary identifies the threefold divine realm as the Tusita (Contented) heaven, but doesn’t explain why that heaven would be given this name. Some verses in the Jātaka identify the threefold divine realm as the heaven of the Thirty-three, and the later reference to “those groups of devas” in this poem would seem to support this latter interpretation.
              8. An epithet for the Buddha, meaning “resplendent.” Aṅgīrasa was the name of an ancient brahmanical sage to which the Gotama clan claimed a connection. The Commentary suggests that this was one of the bodhisatta’s personal names prior to his awakening.

    Thag 10:2  Ekavihāriya—“Dwelling Alone”NavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/10:2
            This poem, which is attributed to King Asoka’s younger brother, falls into three parts: The first expresses his initial desire to leave the life of the palace and go into the forest; the second depicts his going forth; and the third announces his awakening. Some scholars have suggested that many of the poems dealing with events in the lives of the early Buddhist monks and nuns may have originally been intended for dramatic performance, and this poem could easily have been written with that intent. The language of the original, with its heavy use of poetic terms, certainly indicates that the author had a literary background and was writing for a sophisticated audience.
            
              If, in front or behind,
              there is no one else,
              it’s extremely pleasant
              for one staying alone
              in the forest.
              
                Come then! Alone
                I will go to the wilderness
                praised     by the Awakened One
                pleasant     for a resolute monk
                dwelling alone.
              
              
                Alone,
                astute in my goal,
                I’ll quickly enter the grove
                —refreshing,
                giving rapture
                to meditators—
                the haunt
                of elephants in rut.
              
              
                When the Cool Forest’s in full flower,
                in a cool mountain gorge,
                having bathed my limbs
                I’ll walk back & forth
                alone.
              
              
                Ah, when will I dwell,
                alone and free from companions,
                in the refreshing great forest—
                my task done,
                effluent-free?
              
              
                As I desire to do this,
                may my purpose succeed.
                I myself
                will bring it about.
                No one can do it
                for anyone else.

                and will not emerge
                without having attained
                the end of the effluents.
              
              
                While soft breezes blow—
                cool,
                heavily, fragrantly scented—
                I’ll make ignorance burst,
                as I sit on a mountaintop.
              
              
                In the forest covered with blossoms
                or perhaps on a cool hillside,

              Full of the many clans of impurities,
              the great manufacturer of excrement,
              like a stagnant pool,
              a great tumor,
              great wound,
              full of blood & lymph,
              immersed in a cesspool,
              trickling liquids,       the body
              is oozing foulness—always.
              Bound together with sixty sinews,
              plastered with a stucco of muscle,
              wrapped in a jacket of skin,
              this foul body is of no worth at all.
              Linked together with a chain of bones,
              stitched together with tendon-threads,
              it produces its various postures,
              from being hitched up together.
              
                Headed surely to death,
                in the presence of the King of Mortality,
                the man who learns to discard it right here,
                goes wherever he wants.
              
              
                Covered with ignorance,
                the body’s tied down with a four-fold tie,1
                sunk in the floods,2
                caught in the net of obsessions,3
                conjoined with five hindrances,4
                given over to thought,
                accompanied with the root of craving,
                roofed with delusion’s roofing.
                That’s how the body functions,
                compelled by the compulsion of kamma,
                but its attainment ends
                in ruin.
                Its many becomings go
                to ruin.
              
              
                These who hold to this body as mine
                —blind fools, people run-of-the-mill—
                fill the horrific cemetery,
                taking on further becoming.
                Those who stay uninvolved with this body
                —as they would with a serpent
                smeared with dung—
                disgorging the root of becoming,5
                will, without effluent,
                totally unbind.
              
            
            
              Notes
              1. The four-fold tie: greed, ill will, attachment to habits & practice, and dogmatic obsession with views.
              2. Floods: sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance. See SN 45:171. These are identical with the four yokes. See AN 4:10.
              3. Obsessions: sensual passion, resistance, views, uncertainty, conceit, passion for becoming, and ignorance. See AN 7:11–12.
              4. Hindrances: sensual desire, ill will, sloth & drowsiness, restlessness & anxiety, and uncertainty. See DN 2 and SN 46:51.
              5. The root of becoming: craving.

              Notes
              1. Ujjuhāna. The Commentary offers two interpretations for this word. The first is that it is a hill covered with jungle and many streams that tended to overflow in the rainy season. The other is that it is the name of a bird that could stay comfortable even when exposed to cold, wind, and rain. I’ve chosen the second alternative. K. R. Norman speculates that the term could be written ujjahāna, in which case it would be the present participle for a verb meaning “abandoned” or “cast off.” However, none of the manuscripts support his speculation.
              2. In other words, the sight of the crow taking up residence in skulls and other body parts provided a chastening perspective on how the mind takes up residence in the body.
              3. The guide to becoming is craving.

              Here master the virtue
              that in this world is well-mastered,
              for virtue, when cultivated,
              brings every consummation near.
              
                Wise, one should protect one’s virtue,
                aspiring to three pleasures:
                praise, the gaining of wealth,
                and—after death—rejoicing in heaven.
              
              
                The virtuous one, through restraint,
                acquires many friends,
                while the unvirtuous one, practicing evil,
                from friends is estranged.
              
              
                The unvirtuous person gains
                disrepute & dishonor;
                the virtuous person, always,
                repute, honor, & praise.
              
              
                Virtue is the beginning, the establishing,
                the mother of what is fine,
                the foremost of all qualities:
                Therefore virtue should be purified.
              
              
                Virtue is also control, restraint,
                the delight of the mind,
                the ford of all Buddhas:
                Therefore virtue should be purified.
              
              
                Virtue:     an incomparable strength.
                Virtue:     the ultimate weapon.
                Virtue:     the highest adornment.
                Virtue:     an astounding coat of mail.
                Virtue:     an imposing bridge.
                Virtue:     an unexcelled fragrance.
                Virtue:     the highest fragrant ointment
                by which one wafts
                this direction & that.
                Virtue:     the supreme provision.
                Virtue:     the ultimate food for the journey.
                Virtue:     the highest vehicle
                by which one goes1
                this direction & that.
              
              
                Right here he gains blame,
                and after death, in deprivation,
                he’s unhappy at heart:
                Everywhere the fool
                is unhappy at heart,
                not concentrated on virtues.
              
              
                Right here he gains honor
                and after death, in heaven,
                is happy at heart:
                Everywhere the enlightened one
                is happy at heart,
                well-concentrated on virtues.
              
              
                Here virtue is supreme,
                but one with discernment is the ultimate.
                Among human beings & devas
                one conquers
                through virtue & discernment.
              
            
            
              Note

            Thag 12:2  Sunīta the OutcasteNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/12:2
            
              Into a lowly family I was born,
              poor, with next to no food.
              My work was degrading:
              I gathered the spoiled,
              the withered flowers from shrines
              and threw them away.
              People found me disgusting,
              despised me, disparaged me.
              Lowering my heart,
              I showed reverence to many.
              
                Then I saw the One Self-awakened,
                arrayed with a squadron of monks,
                the Great Hero, entering the city,
                supreme, of the Magadhans.
                Throwing down my carrying pole,
                I approached him to do reverence.
                He—the supreme man—stood still
                out of sympathy
                just
                for me.
                After paying homage
                to the feet of the teacher,
                I stood to one side
                & requested the Going Forth from him,
                supreme among all living beings.
              
              
                The compassionate Teacher,
                sympathetic to all the world, said:
                “Come, monk.”
                That was my formal Acceptance.
              
              
                Alone, I stayed in the wilds,
                untiring,
                I followed the Teacher’s words,
                just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.
              
              
                In the first watch of the night,
                I recollected previous lives;
                in the middle watch,
                purified the divine eye;
                in the last,
                burst the mass of darkness.
              
              
                Then, as night was ending
                & the sun returning,
                Indra & Brahmā came to pay homage to me,
                hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:
                “Homage to you,
                O thoroughbred of men,
                Homage to you,
                O man supreme,
                whose effluents are ended.
                You, dear sir,
                are worthy of offerings.”
              
              
                Seeing me,
                arrayed with a squadron of devas,
                the Teacher smiled & said:
                “Through austerity, celibacy,
                restraint, & self-control:
                That’s how one is a brahman.
                He is a brahman supreme.”

          Who once was highly exalted in the state,
          having gone into the service of the king of Aṅga,1
          today is exalted in qualities:
          Soṇa, gone beyond suffering.
          
            Five should be cut, five abandoned,
            and five above all developed.
            Having gone past five bonds,2
            a monk is said to be
            one who’s crossed over.
          
          
            For a monk who is insolent, heedless,
            wishing for what’s outside,
            virtue, concentration, & discernment
            don’t go to completion,
            because what should be done is cast        aside,
            what shouldn’t be done        is done.
            For those who are insolent, heedless,
            their effluents increase.
          
          
            But those whose mindfulness immersed in the body
            is constantly well-undertaken,
            —who don’t engage in what shouldn’t be done,
            who persevere in what should be done,
            mindful, alert—
            their effluents go to their end.
          
          
            Go by the straight path pointed out,
            don’t turn back.
            You yourself should reprove yourself3
            should advance to unbinding.
          
          
            When I overexerted my effort,
            the Teacher unexcelled in the world,
            the One with Eyes,
            making the lute simile,
            taught me the Dhamma.
            I, having heard his words,
            dwelled delighting in his bidding.
            I practiced in tune,4
            attaining the foremost goal.
            The three knowledges are attained.
            The Buddha’s bidding, done.
          
          
            When one’s awareness is dedicated5
            to renunciation, seclusion,
            non-afflictiveness, the ending of clinging,
            the ending of craving, & non-deludedness,
            seeing the arising of the sense media,
            the mind is rightly released.
            For that monk, rightly released,
            his heart at peace.
            There’s nothing to be done,
            nothing to add
            to what’s done.
          
          
            As a single mass of rock isn’t moved by the wind,
            even so all
            forms, flavors, sounds,
            aromas, contacts,
            ideas desirable & not,
            have no effect on one who is Such.
            The mind
            —still, totally released—
            focuses on
            their passing away.
          
        
        
          Notes
          1. Ven. Soṇa’s story is told in AN 6:55 and Mv V.1. The Mahāvagga version states that he was a native of Aṅga, but says nothing about his having been in the service of the king.
          2. According to the Commentary, the five that should be cut are the five lower fetters; the five that should be abandoned are the five higher fetters (see AN 10:13); the five that should be developed are the five faculties: conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment (see SN 48:10). The five bonds are passion, aversion, delusion, conceit, and views.
          3. This line also appears in Dhp 379.
          4. The Thai, Burmese, and Sri Lankan editions here read samathaṁ, “tranquility.” However, I have chosen to follow the PTS edition in reading samataṁ, “in tune,” which seems to fit better with the message of the simile. Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and actions. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments, metaphors for good. For more on this point, see MN 61, note 2, and The Wings to Awakening, I.A.
          5. From this line to the end is the poem that, according to AN 6:55 and Mv V.1.27, was part of Ven. Soṇa’s declaration of arahantship to the Buddha.

            Thag 14:1  Revata’s FarewellNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/14:1
            
              Since I went forth
              from home into homelessness,
              I haven’t known
              an ignoble, aversive resolve.
              “May these beings
              be destroyed,
              be slaughtered,
              fall into pain”—
              I’ve not known this resolve
              in this long, long time.
              But I have known goodwill,
              unlimited,
              fully developed,
              nurtured step after step,
              as taught by the One
              Awake:
              to all, a friend;
              to all, a comrade;
              for all beings, sympathetic.1
              
                And I develop a mind of goodwill,
                delighting in non-malevolence
                —always.
                Unvanquished, unshaken,
                I gladden the mind.
                I develop the sublime abiding,
                not frequented by
                the lowly.
              
              
                Attaining no-thinking,
                the disciple of the Rightly
                Self-awakened One
                is endowed with noble silence2
                straightaway.
              
              
                As a mountain of rock
                is unmoving,
                firmly established,
                so a monk,
                with the ending of delusion,
                like a mountain,
                doesn’t quake.
              
              
                To a person without blemish,
                in constant quest of what’s pure,
                a hair-tip of evil
                seems a storm cloud.
              
              
                As a frontier fortress is guarded
                within & without,
                you should safeguard yourselves.
                Don’t let the moment
                pass you by.
              
              
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time
                like a worker his wage.
                I don’t delight in death,
                don’t delight in living.
                I await my time,
                mindful, alert.
              
              
                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;
                the heavy load,       laid down;
                the guide to becoming,   uprooted.
                And the goal for which I went forth
                from home life into homelessness
                I’ve reached:
                the end
                of all fetters.
              
              
                Attain consummation
                through heedfulness:
                That is my message.
              
              
                So then, I’m about to
                unbind.
                I’m released
                everywhere.3
              
            
            
              Notes
              1. On the development of goodwill as an unlimited attitude, see MN 21 and SN 42:8.
              2. Noble silence = the second jhāna.
              3. AN 3:77 and AN 3:78 use the analogy of a field to describe becoming, in which kamma is the field, craving the moisture, and consciousness the seed. The logic of the analogy suggests that if consciousness is not watered by craving, and does not land in any place (see SN 12:64), it is like a seed without moisture or a field. Therefore it will not sprout into further becoming. Poems in the Canon often describe the arahant as being “everywhere released” (sabbattha vimutto—see Dhp 348) or “everywhere independent” (sabbattha anissito—see Sn 4:6), referring indirectly to this analogy. Translators, lacking a sense of the underlying image of the idiom, have tended to render it in more prosaic terms: “completely released in every respect,” “not dependent on anything,” “released from everything.” However, in light of the field analogy, the idiom means precisely what it says: The arahant is released from every possible “where,” whether fabricated or not—every possible spot for renewed becoming.

              Just as a fine, well-bred bull

              enduring his load,
              crushed
              by the heavy burden,
              doesn’t throw down his yoke;

                stand firm

    Thag 15:2  UdāyinNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/15:2
            In AN 6:43, Ven. Udāyin recites these verses spontaneously in the Buddha’s presence after the king’s elephant (nāga) has passed by, and the Buddha defines the foremost nāga in these terms: “But, Udāyin, whoever in this world—with its devas, Māras, & Brahmās, its people with their contemplatives & brahmans, their royalty & commonfolk—does no misdeed in body, speech, or mind: That’s whom I call a nāga.” The Buddha’s definition hints at a play on words: “Does no misdeed,” in Pali, is āguṁ na karoti, which could be rephrased as na āguṁ karoti, yielding a play on the word nāga. In these verses, Ven. Udāyin shows that he has picked up on the hint by rephrasing it in precisely that way.
            
              A human being, self-awakened,
              his mind tamed, concentrated,
              traveling along the Brahmā road,
              delighting in the stilling of the mind:
              He, having gone beyond all dhammas,1
              to whom human beings pay homage,
              the devas pay homage as well—
              so I have heard from the Worthy One
              —to him, gone past all fetters,
              gone from the forest to the clearing,2
              delighting in the renunciation of sensuality,
              released like gold from its ore.
              
                He, the nāga outshining all others,
                as the Himalayas, rocky hills:
                Among all things named nāga,
                he, unexcelled, is truly named.
              
              
                I will praise the nāga to you—
                for he does no misdeed.
                Composure & harmlessness
                are the nāga’s two feet.
                Austerity & celibacy
                are the nāga’s two other feet.
                Conviction is the great nāga’s trunk,
                his hand;3
                equanimity, his white tusks.
                Mindfulness his neck; his head:
                discernment,
                discrimination,
                reflection on dhammas;
                Dhamma the balanced heat of his digestion;
                seclusion his tail.
                He, in jhāna, delighting in assurance,
                inwardly well-concentrated,
                the nāga, when going,       is concentrated,
                when standing, the nāga     is concentrated,
                when reclining, the nāga     is concentrated,
                when sitting, the nāga       is concentrated.
                Everywhere he’s restrained, the nāga:
                That is the nāga’s consummation.
              
              
                He eats what is blameless;
                doesn’t eat what is not;
                on gaining food & clothing,
                doesn’t store it up.
                Having cut all bonds,
                fetters tiny & large,
                wherever he goes,
                he goes without longing.
                Like a white lotus, born & growing in the water,
                but not smeared by the water
                —fragrant, delightful—
                even so the awakened one,
                well-born in the world, lives in the world,
                but is not smeared by the world,
                like the lotus, by the water.
              
              
                A great blazing fire
                unnourished grows calm,
                and though its embers exist4
                is described as unbound:
                Conveying an instructive meaning,
                this image is taught by the observant.
                Great nāgas will recognize
                the nāga as taught by the nāga
                as free from passion,
                free from aversion,
                free from delusion,
                effluent-free.
                His body discarded, the nāga
                will, without effluent,
                totally unbind.
              
            
            
              Notes
              1. On the point that arahants have gone beyond all dhammas, see AN 3:137, note 1.
              2. Clearing = nibbāna, which is here presented as a play on the word, vana, or forest.
              3. In Pali, an elephant’s trunk is called its “hand” (hattha). In fact, one of the words for “elephant” is hatthin, “one having a hand.”
              4. Aṅgāresu ca santesu. The phrase is apparently meant as a play on words, in that santesu can be the locative either of santa, calm, or sant, existing. Either possibility fits into what seems to be point of this last section of the poem, which is to provide an image to illustrate the difference between the sa-upādisesa-nibbāna of the living arahant—literally, unbinding with fuel remaining—and the anupādisesa-nibbāna of the arahant who has passed away—literally, unbinding with no fuel remaining. In other words, the unbinding of the living arahant is like a fire that has grown calm and whose embers are calm but still warm; the unbinding of the arahant after death is like a fire whose embers have grown totally cold.
              Iti 44 describes the property of sa-upādisesa-nibbāna as follows: “His [the arahant’s] five sense faculties still remain and, owing to their being intact, he experiences the pleasing & the displeasing, and is sensitive to pleasure & pain. His ending of passion, aversion, & delusion is termed the unbinding property with fuel remaining.” Its description of the property of anupādisesa-nibbāna is: “For him, all that is sensed, being unrelished, will grow cold right here. This is termed the unbinding property with no fuel remaining.” For further discussion of this distinction, see The Mind Like Fire Unbound, chapter 1.

            Thag 16:1  Adhimutta & the BanditsNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/16:1
            
              The bandit chief:
              “Those who
              for the sake of sacrifice
              for the sake of wealth
              we have killed in the past,
              against their will
              have trembled & babbled
              from fear.
              But you—
              you show no fear;
              your complexion brightens.
              Why don’t you lament
              in the face of what’s greatly to be feared?”
              
                Ven. Adhimutta:
                “There are no painful mind-states, chieftain,
                in one without longing.
                In one whose fetters are ended,
                all fears are overcome.
                With the ending of [craving]
                the guide to becoming,
                when phenomena are seen
                for what they are,
                then as in the laying down of a burden,
                there’s no fear in death.
              
              
                I’ve lived well the holy life,
                well-developed the path.
                Death holds no fear for me.
                It’s like the end of a disease.
              
              
                I’ve     lived well the holy life,
                well-developed the path,
                seen states of becoming
                as devoid of allure,
                like poison spit out
                after it’s drunk.
              
              
                One gone to the far shore
                without clinging,
                effluent-free,
                his task completed,
                welcomes the ending of life,
                as if freed from a place of execution.
                Having attained the supreme Rightness,
                unconcerned with all the world,
                as if released from a burning house,
                he doesn’t sorrow at death.
              
              
                Whatever’s compounded,
                wherever a state of becoming’s obtained,
                all that has no one in charge:
                So says the Great Seer.
                Whoever discerns this,
                as taught by the Awakened One,
                would no more grasp hold
                of any state of becoming
                than he would
                a hot iron ball.
                I have no ‘I was,’
                no ‘I will be.’
                Fabrications will simply
                go out of existence.
                What’s to lament there in that?
                For one who sees, as it actually is,
                the pure arising of phenomena,
                the pure seriality of fabrications,
                there’s no fear.
              
              
                When seeing the world,
                with discernment,
                as on a par
                with grass & twigs,
                finding no ‘mine-ness,’
                thinking, ‘There’s nothing of mine,’
                he feels no sorrow.
                Dissatisfied with this carcass,
                I’m unconcerned with becoming.
                This body will break up
                and there will not be another.
                Do as you like with this carcass.
                From that I will feel
                neither hatred nor love.”
              
              
                Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,
                the young men threw down their weapons & said:
              
              
                “What have you done, sir,
                or who have you taken as mentor?
                Because of whose teachings
                is this lack of sorrow acquired?”
              
              
                Ven. Adhimutta:
                “The all-knowing,
                all-seeing conqueror:
                He is my mentor.
                Greatly compassionate teacher,
                all the world’s healer,
                this doctrine is his,
                unexcelled, leading to ending.
                Because of his teachings
                is this lack of sorrow acquired.”
              
              
                The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,
                threw down their swords & their weapons.
                Some relinquished their life of crime,
                some chose the Going-forth.
                Having gone forth in the teachings
                of the One Well-Gone,
                developing the strengths
                & factors for awakening,1
                wise, happy,
                exultant in mind,
                their faculties ripened,
                they touched uncompounded unbinding.

    Thag 16:4  RaṭṭhapālaNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/16:4
            The verses here fall into three sections, with the first two relating to Raṭṭhapāla’s story as told in MN 82. In the first, Raṭṭhapāla is addressing his father after the latter had tried to use wealth and Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives to lure Ratthapala into disrobing. In the second section, Raṭṭhapāla is talking to King Koravya, who had asked him why he had ordained when he was still young and healthy, and had suffered no loss of relatives or wealth.
            The third section of verses here does not occur in MN 82.
            
              Look at the image beautified,
              a heap of festering wounds, shored up:
              ill, but the object
              of many resolves,
              where there is nothing
              lasting or sure.1
              
                Look at the form beautified
                with earrings & gems:
                a skeleton wrapped in skin,
                made attractive with clothes.
              
              
                Feet reddened with henna,
                a face smeared with powder:
                enough to deceive a fool,
                but not a seeker for the further shore.
              
              
                Hair plaited in eight pleats,
                eyes smeared with unguent:
                enough to deceive a fool,
                but not a seeker for the further shore.
              
              
                Like a newly painted unguent pot—
                a putrid body adorned:
                enough to deceive a fool,
                but not a seeker for the further shore.
              
              
                The hunter set out the snares,
                but the deer didn’t go near the trap.
                Having eaten the bait,
                we go,
                leaving the hunters
                to weep.
              
              
                The hunter’s snares are broken;
                the deer didn’t go near the trap.
                Having eaten the bait,
                we go,
                leaving the hunters
                to grieve.2

                I see in the world
                people with wealth
                who, from delusion,
                don’t make a gift
                of the treasure they’ve gained.
                Greedy, they stash it away,
                hoping for even more
                sensual pleasures.
              
              
                A king who, by force,
                has conquered the world
                and rules over the earth
                to the edge of the sea,
                dissatisfied with the ocean’s near shore,
                longs for the ocean’s
                far shore as well.
              
              
                Kings & others
                —plenty of people—
                go to death with craving
                unabated. Unsated,
                they leave the body behind,
                having not had enough
                of the world’s sensual pleasures.
              
              
                One’s relatives weep
                & pull out their hair.
                ‘Oh woe, our loved one is dead,’ they cry.
                Carrying him off,
                wrapped in a piece of cloth,
                they place him
                on a pyre,
                then set him on fire.
              
              
                So he burns, poked with sticks,
                in just one piece of cloth,
                leaving all his possessions behind.
                They are not shelters for one who has died—
                not relatives,
                friends,
                or companions.
              
              
                Heirs take over his wealth,
                while the being goes on,
                in line with his kamma.
                No wealth at all
                follows the dead one—
                not children, wives,
                dominion, or riches.
              
              
                Long life
                can’t be gotten with wealth,
                nor aging
                warded off with treasure.
                The wise say this life
                is next to nothing—
                impermanent,
                subject to change.
              
              
                The rich & the poor
                touch the touch of Death.
                The foolish & wise
                are touched by it, too.
                But while fools lie as if slain by their folly,
                the wise don’t tremble
                when touched by the touch.
              
              
                Thus the discernment by which
                one attains to mastery,
                is better than wealth—
                for those who haven’t reached mastery
                go from existence to existence,
                out of delusion,
                doing bad deeds.
              
              
                One goes to a womb
                & to the next world,
                falling into the wandering on
                —one thing
                after another—
                while those of weak discernment,
                trusting in one,
                also go to a womb
                & to the next world.
              
              
                Just as an evil thief
                caught at the break-in
                is destroyed
                by his own act,
                so evil people
                —after dying, in the next world—
                are destroyed
                by their own acts.
              
              
                Sensual pleasures—
                variegated,
                enticing,
                sweet—
                in various ways disturb the mind.
                Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects:
                that’s why, O king, I went forth.
              
              
                Just like fruits, people fall
                —young & old—
                at the break-up of the body.
                Knowing this, O king,
                I went forth.
                The contemplative life is better
                for sure.3

                Out of conviction,
                I went forth
                equipped with the Victor’s message.
                Blameless4 was my going-forth:
                Debtless I eat my food.
              
              
                Seeing sensuality as burning,
                gold as a knife,
                pain in the entry into the womb
                & great danger in hells—
                seeing this peril, I was then dismayed—
                pierced (with dismay),
                then calmed
                on attaining the end of the effluents.
                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;
                the heavy load,       laid down;
                the guide to becoming,5   uprooted.
              
              
                And the goal for which I went forth
                from home life into homelessness
                I’ve reached:
                the end
                of all fetters.

                Abandoning a 100-carat bowl of bronze
                and a 100-weight bowl of gold,
                I took instead a bowl of clay:
                That was my second consecration.
              
              
                In the midst of high encircling walls,
                strong battlements & gates,
                guarded by men with swords in hand—
                trembling
                I used to live.
                Today, fortunate, unafraid,
                with fear & terror abandoned,
                Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
                having plunged into the forest,
                does jhāna.

                the ending of all fetters.

    Thag 16:8  AṅgulimālaNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/16:8
            Aṅgulumāla’s story is told in MN 86.
            
              Aṅgulimāla:
              “While walking, contemplative,
              you say, ’I have stopped.’
              But when I have stopped
              you say that I haven’t.
              I ask you the meaning of this:
              How have you stopped?
              How haven’t I?”
              
                The Buddha:
                “I have stopped, Aṅgulimāla,
                once & for all,
                having cast off violence
                toward all living beings.
                You, though,
                are unrestrained toward beings.
                That’s how I’ve stopped
                and you haven’t.”
              
              
                Aṅgulimāla:
                “At long last a greatly revered great seer
                for my sake
                has come to the great forest.
                Having heard your verse
                in line with the Dhamma,
                I will go about
                having abandoned evil.”
              
              
                So saying, the bandit
                hurled his sword & weapons
                over a cliff
                into a chasm,
                a pit.
                Then the bandit paid homage
                to the feet of the One Well-Gone,
                and right there requested the Going-forth.
              
              
                The Awakened One,
                the compassionate great seer,
                the teacher of the world, along with its devas,
                said to him then:
                “Come, monk.”
                That in itself
                was monkhood for him.
              
              
                * * *
                Aṅgulimāla:
                Who once was heedless,
                but later is not,
                brightens the world
                like the moon set free from a cloud.1
                His evil-done deed
                is replaced with skillfulness:
                He brightens the world
                like the moon set free from a cloud.2
              
              
                Whatever young monk
                devotes himself
                to the Buddha’s bidding:
                He brightens the world
                like the moon set free from a cloud.
              
              
                May even my enemies
                hear talk of the Dhamma.
                May even my enemies
                devote themselves
                to the Buddha’s bidding.
                May even my enemies
                associate with those people
                who—peaceful, good—
                get others to accept the Dhamma.
                May even my enemies
                hear the Dhamma time & again
                from those who advise     endurance,
                forbearance,
                who praise non-opposition,
                and may they follow it.
              
              
                For surely he wouldn’t harm me,
                or anyone else;
                he would attain     the foremost peace,
                would protect     the feeble & firm.
              
              
                Irrigators guide     the water.
                Fletchers shape     the arrow shaft.
                Carpenters shape     the wood.
                The wise control
                themselves.3
              
              
                Some tame with a blunt stick,
                with hooks, & with whips
                But without blunt or bladed weapons
                I was tamed by the one who is Such.
              
              
                “Doer of No Harm” is my name,
                but I used to be a doer of harm.
                Today I am true to my name,
                for I harm no one at all.
              
              
                A bandit
                I used to be,
                renowned as Aṅgulimāla.
                Swept along by a great flood,
                I went to the Buddha as refuge.
              
              
                Bloody-handed
                I used to be,
                renowned as Aṅgulimāla.
                See my going for refuge!
                Uprooted is [craving],
                the guide to becoming.
              
              
                Having done the type of kamma
                that would lead to many
                bad destinations,
                touched by the fruit of [that] kamma,
                unindebted, I eat my food.4
              
              
                They’re addicted to heedlessness
                —dullards, fools—
                while one who is wise
                cherishes heedfulness
                as his highest wealth.5
              
              
                Don’t give way to heedlessness
                or to intimacy
                with sensual delight—
                for a heedful person,
                absorbed in jhāna,
                attains an abundant bliss.6
              
              
                This7 has come well & not gone away,
                it was not badly thought through for me.
                From among well-analyzed qualities,
                I have obtained
                the best.
              
              
                This has come well & not gone away,
                it was not badly thought through for me.
                The three knowledges
                have been attained;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done.8
              
              
                Where once I stayed here & there
                with shuddering mind—
                in the wilderness,
                at the foot of a tree,
                in mountains,
                caves—
                with ease I now lie down, I stand,
                with ease I live my life.
                O, the Teacher has shown me sympathy!
              
              
                Before, I was of brahman stock,
                on either side high-born.
                Today I’m the son
                of the One Well-Gone,
                the Dhamma-king,
                the Teacher.
              
              
                Rid of craving, devoid of clinging,
                sense-doors guarded, well-restrained,
                having killed the root of evil,
                I’ve reached the end of the effluents.
              
              
                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;
                the guide to becoming,     uprooted;
                the heavy load,       laid down.

              4. This verse illustrates the kammic principle stated in AN 3:101. This is one of the ways in which the Buddhist doctrine of kamma differed from that of the Jains. For them, a person could not reach arahantship without having suffered retribution for every kammic misdeed, a process that could take many lifetimes—in the course of which, one might create more bad kamma, delaying arahantship still further. But for the Buddhists, training in virtue, discernment, and the ability not to be overcome by pleasure or pain could take the mind to a state where the results of past bad kamma would “be experienced in the here-and-now, and for the most part would appear only for a moment.” In other words, in the Buddhist teaching, but not in the Jain, the state of the mind in the present plays a major role in how the effects of past kamma will be experienced.

        Thag 17:2  SāriputtaNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/17:2
        This is not a single, unified poem. Instead, it is a compilation of verses that—apparently over the course of many years—became associated with Ven. Sāriputta’s name. Some of them may have been his original compositions. Others are verses that other people spoke about him. One in particular is also found in Ud 3:4, where the Buddha is said to have exclaimed it on seeing Sāriputta meditating. Some of the verses that make no mention of Sāriputta are, in other parts of the Canon, attributed to the Buddha, suggesting that they might have been those that Sāriputta’s liked to repeat.
        One of the verses, toward the end of the collection, makes reference to the perfection of discernment. The teaching on the perfections is elsewhere found only in later additions to the Canon, suggesting that this compilation as a whole was also late. This, however, does not rule out the possibility that some of the individual verses were early.
        Also, it should be noted that a large number of the verses here are also found in Thag 14:1. This pattern of borrowing that occurs from one poem to another is a common occurrence in the Theragāthā, suggesting that the compilers of the collection felt no qualms about standardizing the sentiments of the great elders.

            he shouldn’t be heavily sated.
            With unfilled belly, with measured food,
            the monk should wander
            mindfully.
          
          
            Leaving four or five mouthfuls uneaten,
            he should drink water:
            This is enough
            for the easeful abiding
            of a resolute monk.
          
          
            And he covers himself with a proper robe
            enough for that purpose:
            This is enough
            for the easeful abiding
            of a resolute monk.
          
          
            As he sits cross-legged,
            it doesn’t rain on his knees:
            This is enough
            for the easeful abiding
            of a resolute monk.
          
          
            Whoever sees pleasure as pain,
            and pain as an arrow,
            and that there’s nothing between the two:
            With what will he be what in the world?
          
          
            “May I never have anything to do
            with a person of evil desires,
            lazy, lowly in his persistence,
            with little learning, disrespectful”:
            With what will he be what in the world?
          
          
            But one who is learned, wise,
            well-centered in virtues,
            devoted to tranquility of awareness:
            Let him stand at the head.
          
          
            One who is devoted to objectification,2
            his heart delighting in objectification,
            attains no unbinding,
            the unexcelled rest from the yoke.
          
          
            But whoever, abandoning objectification,
            delighting in the path of non-objectification,
            attains unbinding,
            the unexcelled rest from the yoke.
          
          
            In village or wilds,
            valley, plateau:
            that place is delightful
            where arahants dwell.
          
          
            Delightful wilds
            where the crowds don’t delight,
            those free from passion
            delight,
            for they’re not searching
            for sensual pleasures.3
          
          
            Regard him as one who
            points out
            treasure,
            the wise one who
            seeing your faults
            rebukes you.
            Stay with this sort of sage.
            For the one who stays
            with a sage of this sort,
            things get better,
            not worse.
          
          
            Let him admonish, instruct,
            deflect you
            away from poor manners.
            To the good, he’s endearing;
            to the bad, he’s not.4
          
          
            He, the Blessed One, the One
            Awakened, the One with Eyes,
            was teaching Dhamma to another.
            And while the Dhamma was being taught,
            I, desiring the Dhamma,
            turned an attentive ear.
            My listening was not in vain:
            I’m released, effluent-free.5
          
          
            Not for knowledge of previous lifetimes,
            nor for the divine eye,
            nor for knowledge of others’ minds,
            nor for psychic power,
            nor for knowledge of beings dying & being reborn,
            nor for purifying the divine ear
            did I have any aspiration.
          
          
            Sitting at the root of a tree,
            with shaven head,
            wrapped in an outer robe,
            the elder foremost in discernment:
            Upatissa does jhāna.6
          
          
            Attaining no-thinking,
            the disciple of the Rightly
            Self-Awakened One
            is endowed with noble silence
            straightaway.7
          
          
            As a mountain of rock
            is unwavering, well-settled,
            so a monk whose delusion is ended
            doesn’t quiver—
            just like a mountain.8
          
          
            To a person without blemish,
            in constant quest of what’s pure,
            a hair-tip of evil
            seems a storm cloud.
          
          
            I don’t delight in death,
            don’t delight in living.
            I await my time
            like a worker his wage.
            I don’t delight in death,
            don’t delight in living.
            I await my time,
            mindful, alert.
          
          
            On either side is death,
            it’s not non-death, ahead or behind.
            Practice, don’t perish.
            Don’t let the moment pass you by.
          
          
            As a frontier fortress is guarded
            within & without,
            you should safeguard yourselves.
            Don’t let the moment
            pass you by.
            Those for whom the moment is past
            grieve, consigned to hell.9
          
          
            Calmed, restrained,
            giving counsel unruffled,
            he shakes off evil qualities—
            as the breeze,
            a leaf from a tree.10
          
          
            Calmed, restrained,
            giving counsel unruffled,
            he removed evil qualities—
            as the breeze,
            a leaf from a tree.
          
          
            You shouldn’t trust in this way
            some householders or those gone forth.
            Having been good, they become bad.
            Having been bad, they become good.
          
          
            Sensual desire, ill will,
            sloth & torpor,
            restlessness & uncertainty:
            These, for a monk, are the five defilements.
          
          
            The concentration of one
            dwelling in heedfulness
            doesn’t waver,
            whether he is honored or not.
            Doing jhāna, persevering,
            having
            subtle insight into
            subtle views,
            delighting in the ending of clinging:
            He’s called a man of integrity.
          
          
            The great ocean, the Earth,
            a mountain, even the wind
            aren’t fitting as a comparison
            for the Teacher’s foremost release.
          
          
            Keeping the (Dhamma) wheel going,
            the elder of great knowledge, centered,
            being like earth, fire, & water,
            is neither impassioned nor angered.11
          
          
            Having attained perfection in discernment,12
            greatly intelligent, a great sage,
            not dull, though seemingly dull,
            he always wanders        unbound.
          
          
            The Teacher has been served by me;
            the Awakened One’s bidding,
            done;
            the heavy load,        laid down;
            the guide to becoming,        uprooted.
          
          
            Attain consummation
            through heedfulness:
            That is my message.
            So then, I’m about to
            unbind.
            I’m released
            everywhere.13

              One shouldn’t go about
              surrounded, revered
              by a company:
              One gets distracted;
              concentration
              is hard to gain.
              Fellowship with many people
              is painful.
              Seeing this,
              one shouldn’t approve
              of a company.
              
                A sage shouldn’t visit families:
                one gets distracted;
                concentration
                is hard to gain.
                He’s eager & greedy for flavors,
                whoever misses the goal
                that brings bliss.
                They know it’s a bog—
                the reverence & veneration
                of families—
                a subtle arrow, hard to extract.
                Offerings are hard for a worthless man
                to let go.

                Coming down from my dwelling place,
                I entered the city for alms,
                stood courteously next to a leper
                eating his meal.
              
              
                He, with his rotting hand,
                tossed me a morsel of food,
                and as the morsel was dropping,
                a finger fell off
                right there.
              
              
                Sitting next to a wall,
                I ate that morsel of food,
                and neither while eating it,
                nor having eaten,
                did I feel
                any disgust.1
              
              
                Whoever has mastered
                left-over scraps for food,
                smelly urine for medicine,
                the foot of a tree for a dwelling,
                cast-off rags for robes:
                He is a man
                of the four directions.

                Where some are exhausted
                climbing the mountain,
                there2
                the Awakened One’s heir
                —mindful, alert,
                buoyed by his psychic power—
                Kassapa climbs.
              
              
                Returning from his alms round,
                climbing the peak,
                Kassapa does jhāna
                with no clinging,

                Returning from his alms round,

                Returning from his alms round,
                climbing the peak,

                The color of blue-dark clouds,

                of clear-flowing streams
                covered with ladybugs:

                is at one,
                seeing the Dhamma

                One shouldn’t do lots of work,
                should avoid people,
                shouldn’t busy oneself.
                He’s eager & greedy for flavors,
                whoever misses the goal
                that brings bliss.
              
              
                One shouldn’t do lots of work,
                should avoid
                what doesn’t lead to the goal.
                The body gets wearied,
                fatigued.
                Aching, one finds
                no tranquility.

                Simply by flapping the mouth
                one doesn’t see
                even oneself.
                One goes around stiff-
                necked,
                thinking, ‘I’m better
                than they.’
              
              
                Not better,
                he thinks himself better,
                the fool:
                The wise don’t praise him,
                the stiff-necked man.
              
              
                But whoever isn’t stirred
                by the modes of
                ‘I’m better,
                not better.
                I’m worse.
                I’m like that’;
                one who’s discerning,
                who acts as he says,
                well-centered
                in virtues,
                committed to
                tranquility of awareness, he
                is the one
                the wise
                would praise.
              
              
                One with no respect
                for his fellows in the holy life,
                is as far
                from true Dhamma
                as the earth
                from the sky.
              
              
                But those whose sense of shame
                & compunction
                are always rightly established: They
                have flourished in the holy life.
                For them
                there’s no further becoming.
              
              
                A monk conceited & vain,
                even though clad
                in a robe of cast-off rags,
                like a monkey in a lion’s skin,
                doesn’t shine because of it.
              
              
                But a monk not conceited
                or vain,
                masterful,
                his faculties restrained, shines
                because of his robe of cast-off rags,
                like a lion
                in the cleft of a mountain.

                These many devas,
                powerful, prestigious
                —10,000 devas—
                all of Brahmā’s retinue,
                stand with their hands over their hearts,
                paying homage to Sāriputta,
                the Dhamma-general,
                enlightened,4
                centered,
                great master of jhāna,
                [saying:]
              
              
                ‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.
                Homage to you, O superlative man—
                of whom we have no direct knowledge
                even of that
                in dependence on which
                you do jhāna.
              
              
                ‘How very amazing:
                the awakened ones’
                very own deep range—
                of which we have no direct knowledge,
                though we have come
                as hair-splitting archers.’
                Seeing Sāriputta,
                a man worthy of worship,
                worshipped by deva retinues,
                Kappina

                As far as this buddha-field6 extends
                —except for the great sage himself—
                I’m the one
                outstanding
                in ascetic qualities.
                There’s no one else
                like me.
              
              
                The Teacher has been served by me;
                the Awakened One’s bidding,
                done;
                the heavy load,       laid down;
                the guide to becoming,   uprooted.
              
              
                Neither to robe,
                nor dwelling,
                nor food
                does he cling:
                Gotama,
                like a lotus unspotted
                by water, inclining
                to renunciation,   detached
                from the three planes of becoming.7
              
              
                He,
                the great sage,
                has the establishings of mindfulness
                as his neck,
                conviction
                as hands,
                discernment
                as head.8
                Having great knowledge,
                he goes about
                always unbound.
              
            
            
              Notes
              1. This passage has often been misread as saying that the leper’s finger fell into Mahā Kassapa’s bowl, and that Mahā Kassapa actually ate the finger. Nothing in the verse, though, indicates that this is so. It simply says that the finger fell off, and that Mahā Kassapa ate the food. Furthermore, there is a rule in the Mahāvagga—Mv.VI.23.9—that imposes a grave offense on any monk who eats human flesh. So it’s highly unlikely that Mahā Kassapa ate the leper’s finger.
              2. Reading tattha with the Thai and Sinhalese editions.
              3. Reading sikkhato with the Thai edition.
            4. Reading dhīraṁ with the Thai and PTS editions. The Burmese and Sinhalese editions read vīraṁ, “hero.”
            5. Ven. Sāriputta was foremost among the monks in terms of discernment (AN 1:183); Ven. Kappina, foremost among the monks in exhorting other monks (AN 1:231). The Buddha praises him at SN 21:11 for his attainment of psychic powers, and at SN 54:7 for the solidity of his concentration based on mindfulness of breathing.
            6. This appears to be one of the earliest references to “buddha-field,” a concept that was to play a large role in the Apadāna literature and, through that, in the Mahāyāna concept of the Pure Land. Here it appears to mean the sphere of the current Buddha’s influence. In the Apadānas it takes on two other meanings: as (1) a field for producing merit, on the lines of the traditional image of the Saṅgha as the unexcelled field of merit; and (2) a heavenly realm where a particular Buddha dwells. These two meanings were influential in the early Mahāyāna sūtras that formed the basis for Pure Land practice.
            7. The three planes of becoming are the sensual, form, and formlessness. See AN 3:77–78.
            8. See Thag 15:2.
